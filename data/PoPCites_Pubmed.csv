Multivariable Poisson regression using stabilized inverse probability weighting estimated relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs. Any periconceptional OC use was associated with increased risks of pre-eclampsia (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.99-1.93), pre-term birth (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.09-1.75) and low birthweight (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10-1.92), but not with gestational hypertension (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91-1.31), gestational diabetes (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.77-1.36) and SGA (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.75-1.21). Associations with pre-eclampsia were strongest for discontinuation 0-3 months pre-pregnancy, for OCs containing ≥30 µg oestrogen and for first- or second-generation OCs. Pre-term birth and low birthweight were more likely to occur when OCs were discontinued 0-3 months pre-pregnancy, when using OCs containing <30 µg oestrogen and when using third-generation OCs. Associations with SGA were observed for OCs containing <30 µg oestrogen and for third- or fourth-generation OCs. Periconceptional OC use, particularly those containing oestrogen, was associated with increased risks of pre-eclampsia, pre-term birth, low birthweight and SGA.","",""

This antigen was previously determined to bind more favorably than insulin and its mimic (insulin superagonist) to HLA-DQ8, supporting its strong role in CD4+ T cell activation. In this work, we probed HLA-X-idiotype-TCR binding and designed enhanced-reactive pHLA-TCR antigens using an in silico mutagenesis approach which we functionally validated by cell proliferation assays and flow cytometry. From a combination of single, double, and swap mutations, we identified antigen-binding sites p4 and p6 as potential mutation sites for HLA binding affinity enhancement. Site p6 is revealed to favor smaller but more hydrophobic residues than the native tyrosine, such as valine (Y6V) and isoleucine (Y6I), indicating a steric mechanism in binding affinity improvement. Meanwhile, site p4 methionine mutation to hydrophobic residues isoleucine (M4I) or leucine (M4L) modestly increases HLA binding affinity. Select p6 mutations to cysteine (Y6C) or isoleucine (Y6I) exhibit favorable TCR binding affinities, while a swap p5-p6 tyrosine-valine double mutant (V5Y_Y6V) and a p6-p7 glutamine-glutamine double mutant (Y6Q_Y7Q) exhibit enhanced HLA binding affinity but weakened TCR affinity.

Recent evidence supports that several Lactobacillus strains possess glucose-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects in an animal model of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Although probiotics of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei SD1 (SD1) and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus SD11 (SD11) exert human oral health benefits by reducing harmful bacterial populations, their clinical application regarding hypoglycemic-related traits as well as the underlying mechanisms are still lacking. In this report, we used multiple low doses of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic BALB/c mice to explore the effects of SD1 and SD11 supplementation on the regulation of markers related to T1D. Experimental mice were randomly assigned into five groups, non-STZ + V, STZ + V, STZ + SD1, STZ + SD11, and STZ + SDM (mixture of SD1 and SD11), and physiological data were measured every week. Blood and pancreas samples were collected at 4- and 8-weeks. Our results indicate that supplementation with SD1, SD11, or SDM for 8 weeks significantly improved body weights, glycemic levels, glucose tolerance, insulin levels, and lipid profiles. Probiotic administration also preserved islet integrity and increased β-cell mass in STZ-injected mice, as well as prevented infiltration of macrophages, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells into the islets. Significantly, SD1 and SD11 suppressed the levels of IL1-β, TNF-α and IFN-γ and increased IL-10, which is concomitant with the inhibition of cleaved caspase 3, caspase 9, caspase 8, proapoptotic Bax, NF-κBp65, pSTAT1, and iNOS. Additionally, the survival ability of β-cells was mediated by upregulated anti-apoptotic Bcl2. We conclude that SD1 and SD11 attenuate STZ-induced diabetic mice by stabilizing glycemic levels and reducing inflammation, thereby protecting β-cells. Among the probiotic treatment groups, SD11 revealed the best results in almost all parameters, indicating its potential use for alleviating hyperglycemia-associated symptoms.","",""

As T2D is a multifactorial disease with both genetic and nongenetic influences, accurate risk assessments for patients are difficult to perform. Machine learning has served as a useful tool in T2D risk prediction, as it can analyze and detect patterns in large and complex data sets like that of RNA sequencing. However, before machine learning can be implemented, feature selection is a necessary step to reduce the dimensionality in high-dimensional data and optimize modeling results. Different combinations of feature selection methods and machine learning models have been used in studies reporting disease predictions and classifications with high accuracy. The purpose of this study was to assess the use of feature selection and classification approaches that integrate different data types to predict weight loss for the prevention of T2D. The data of 56 participants (ie, demographic and clinical factors, dietary scores, step counts, and transcriptomics) were obtained from a previously completed randomized clinical trial adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program study. Feature selection methods were used to select for subsets of transcripts to be used in the selected classification approaches: support vector machine, logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and extremely randomized decision trees (extra-trees). Data types were included in different classification approaches in an additive manner to assess model performance for the prediction of weight loss. Average waist and hip circumference were found to be different between those who exhibited weight loss and those who did not exhibit weight loss (P=.02 and P=.04, respectively). The incorporation of dietary and step count data did not improve modeling performance compared to classifiers that included only demographic and clinical data. Optimal subsets of transcripts identified through feature selection yielded higher prediction accuracy than when all available transcripts were included. After comparison of different feature selection methods and classifiers, DESeq2 as a feature selection method and an extra-trees classifier with and without ensemble learning provided the most optimal results, as defined by differences in training and testing accuracy, cross-validated area under the curve, and other factors. We identified 5 genes in two or more of the feature selection subsets (ie, CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase [CDIPT], mannose receptor C type 2 [MRC2], PAT1 homolog 2 [PATL2], regulatory factor X-associated ankyrin containing protein [RFXANK], and small ubiquitin like modifier 3 [SUMO3]). Our results suggest that the inclusion of transcriptomic data in classification approaches for prediction has the potential to improve weight loss prediction models. Identification of which individuals are likely to respond to interventions for weight loss may help to prevent incident T2D. Out of the 5 genes identified as optimal predictors, 3 (ie, CDIPT, MRC2, and SUMO3) have been previously shown to be associated with T2D or obesity.

Gut microbiota dysbiosis and increased levels of bacterial component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are associated with diabetic myocardial injury, but the mechanism by which gut microbes affect metabolic inflammation and cardiac injury remains unclear. We determined whether pyridostigmine (PYR), which inhibits cholinesterase to improve vagal activity, could regulate the disordered gut microbiota and attenuate gut barrier dysfunction, metabolic endotoxemia, and inflammation in diabetes. Db/db mice exhibited high blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, low vagal activity, and diabetic myocardial injury. Db/db mice also exhibited gut microbiota perturbations and subsequent disruption of gut barrier function, resulting in an influx of LPS, metabolic endotoxemia, and inflammation. PYR ameliorated the dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism, modulated the overall structure of the gut microbiota, selectively enhanced the abundance of anti-inflammatory bacteria, and reduced the abundance of proinflammatory and potentially pathogenic bacteria in db/db mice. Importantly, PYR enhanced vagal activity, restored gut microbiota homeostasis, and alleviated gut barrier dysfunction. Therefore, the LPS-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/early growth response-1 (Egr-1) pathway and consequent metabolic inflammation were inhibited, and eventually, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and dysfunction were ameliorated in db/db mice. In vitro cardiomyocyte injury was induced by exposing primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes to high glucose (HG) and LPS. In vitro analyses showed that HG + LPS induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, Egr-1 expression, inflammation, and cell apoptosis, which were inhibited by acetylcholine (ACh). Alpha 7 nicotinic ACh receptor but not muscarinic 2 ACh receptor plays an important role in ACh-mediated anti-inflammatory effects and inhibiting the ERK/Egr-1 pathway in HG + LPS-administered neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes.

Excessive energy intake and concomitant obesity are the main drivers of this syndrome. Mitophagy, in which cells degrade damaged mitochondria through a selective form of autophagy, assumes a crucial position in the regulation of mitochondrial integrity and maintenance. Abnormal mitochondrial quality could result in a spectrum of pathological conditions related to metabolic dysfunction, including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular ailments, and neoplasms. Recently, there has been a proliferation of research pertaining to the process of mitophagy in the context of MS, and there are various regulatory pathways in MS, including pathways like the ubiquitin-dependent mechanism and receptor-mediated mechanisms, among others. Furthermore, studies have uncovered that the process of mitophagy serves a defensive function in the advancement of Metabolic Syndrome, and inhibition of mitophagy exacerbates the advancement of MS. As a result, the regulation of mitophagy holds great promise as a therapeutic approach in the management of Metabolic Syndrome.

It has been poorly understood whether autophagy plays a protective or harmful role in β-cells, while we report here that it is dependent on NR3C1/glucocorticoid receptor activation. We proved that deleterious hyperactive autophagy happened only upon NR3C1 activation in β-cells under glucolipotoxic conditions, which eventually promoted diabetes. The transcriptome and the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylome revealed that NR3C1-enhancement upregulated the RNA demethylase FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) protein in β-cells, which caused diminished m6A modifications on mRNAs of four core Atg (autophagy related) genes (Atg12, Atg5, Atg16l2, Atg9a) and, hence, hyperactive autophagy and defective insulin output; by contrast, FTO inhibition, achieved by the specific FTO inhibitor Dac51, prevented NR3C1-instigated excessive autophagy activation. Importantly, Dac51 effectively alleviated impaired insulin secretion and glucose intolerance in hyperglycemic β-cell specific NR3C1 overexpression mice. Our results determine that the NR3C1-FTO-m6A modifications-Atg genes axis acts as a key mediator of balanced autophagic flux in pancreatic β-cells, which offers a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetes.","",""

The objective was to find the effect of obesity on maternal and perinatal outcome among obese pregnant women compared to those of normal weight. The study was conducted in antenatal women attending antenatal outpatient department of of Obstetrics and Gynecology in a teriary care referral hospital in Mumbai. Results recorded in simple percentages. Eighteen percent cases developed gestational diabetes mellitus during their antenatal period and 15% developed gestational hypertension. 44% patients underwent lower segment caesarean section. The need for induction of labour and caesarean section was found to be 37% which is significantly higher. Increased NICU admissions due to hypoglycemia or congenital malformations,prematurity was found to be on a higher side. It was clearly evident from the present study that maternal obesity had adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Maternal obesity was strongly associated with antenatal complications like gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and increase in need for induction of labour and operative interference.","",""

The PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched for articles related to NHR from their inception to October 2022. Seven relevant articles were obtained for review. There were unclear relationships of NHR with age, sex, smoking status, hypertension and diabetes. However, NHR had a sensitivity and specificity as high as 94.8% and 59%, respectively, for the identification of significant coronary stenosis. NHR was also a superior predictor of prognosis to conventional parameters. NHR had a sensitivity and specificity as high as 77.6% and 74.2%, respectively, for the prediction of adverse events, including mortality, associated with acute coronary syndrome. Thus, NHR could be used in clinical cardiovascular medicine for risk stratification and the prediction of the short-term and long-term outcomes of CAD.

We examined the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DN patients and healthy controls, and 36 ferroptosis-related DEGs were selected. Pathway-enrichment analyses showed that many of these genes are involved in metabolic pathways, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signaling. Ten of the 36 ferroptosis-related DEGs (CD44, PTEN, CDKN1A, DPP4, DUSP1, CYBB, DDIT3, ALOX5, VEGFA, and NCF2) were identified as key genes. Expression patterns for six of these (CD44, PTEN, DDIT3, ALOX5, VEGFA, and NCF2) were validated in the GSE30529 dataset. Nephroseq data indicated that the mRNA expression levels of CD44, PTEN, ALOX5, and NCF2 were negatively correlated with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), while VEGFA and DDIT3 mRNA expression levels were positively correlated with GFR. Immune infiltration analysis demonstrated altered immunity in DN patients. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that ALOX5, PTEN, and NCF2 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in high-glucose-treated human proximal tubular (HK-2) cells, while DDIT3 and VEGFA mRNA levels were significantly downregulated.

Thus, this study aimed to explore the association between CRP and POD among those elderly colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. 643 patients with CRC were included in this study. CRP levels were measured before operation and on postoperative day 1. The univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for POD. Of 643 patients with CRC, 112 cases (17.4%) had POD. CRC patients with POD showed older age, higher CRP level on postoperative day 1, and higher percentage of smoking, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than CRC patients without POD. Preoperative CRP level was not associated with the POD. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that older age (> 70 years), diabetes mellitus, COPD, and higher CRP level on postoperative day 1 (> 48 mg/L) were risk factors for POD in CRC patients. Postoperative CRP level is an independent indicator for POD among CRC patients, suggesting the predictive role of postoperative CRP levels for POD in elderly CRC patients undergoing surgery.","",""

It is calculated from the diastolic portion of the radial pulse wave using sophisticated analyses. C2 is used as a cardiovascular risk indicator since it decreases with aging, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Here, we propose an alternative method to assess the distal arteries distensibility by measuring the amplitude of the oscillation that occurs at the beginning of diastole. Peripheral pulse wave was evaluated noninvasively by applanation tonometry in 511 individuals (264 women) aged between 13 and 70 years. Diastolic amplitude (DA) was measured as the peak-to-peak amplitude of the diastolic oscillation. Radial augmentation index (RAIx) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were also calculated. DA decreased approximately 2% per decade of life between 16 and 70 years from 19% to 7%, and was higher in men than in women (p<0.0001). Linear regression analysis identified RAIx as the strongest predictor of AD (p<0.0001), followed by age and height. Sex modified the age-related decrease in DA (p< 0.001). By applying the method to measure DA from previously published data, we found a strong linear correlation with C2. DA decreased linearly with age in a reciprocal manner to the increase in radial augmentation index, was greater in men than women, and was independent of blood pressure and heart rate, as previously reported for C2. We propose that measuring DA could provide an alternative index to evaluate distal arterial compliance and aging.","",""

Dysregulation of these GRNs can cause complex diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and diabetes. Hence, accurate GRN inference is critical for elucidating gene function, allowing for the faster identification and prioritization of candidate genes for functional investigation. Several statistical and machine learning-based methods have been developed to infer GRNs based on biological and synthetic datasets. Here, we developed a method named AGRN that infers GRNs by employing an ensemble of machine learning algorithms. From the idea that a single method may not perform well on all datasets, we calculate the gene importance scores using three machine learning methods-random forest, extra tree and support vector regressors. We calculate the importance scores from Shapley Additive Explanations, a recently published method to explain machine learning models. We have found that the importance scores from Shapley values perform better than the traditional importance scoring methods based on almost all the benchmark datasets. We have analyzed the performance of AGRN using the datasets from the DREAM4 and DREAM5 challenges for GRN inference. The proposed method, AGRN-an ensemble machine learning method with Shapley values, outperforms the existing methods both in the DREAM4 and DREAM5 datasets. With improved accuracy, we believe that AGRN inferred GRNs would enhance our mechanistic understanding of biological processes in health and disease. https://github.com/DuaaAlawad/AGRN.

The expression and localization of TXNIP in the placenta of GDM patients and the health control was investigated via immunofluorescent staining, western blot and RT-qPCR. Overexpression of TXNIP was achieved through transfecting Tet-on system to the human trophoblastic cell line-HTR-8/Svneo cell. TXNIP knockout was obtained via CRISPR-Cas9 method. The cell phenotype was observed via IncuCyte Imaging System and flow cytometry. The mechanism was explored via western blot and RT-qPCR. The expression level of TXNIP in the GDM placenta was nearly 2-3 times higher than that in the control. The TXNIP located at trophoblastic cells of the placenta. When the expression of TXNIP was upregulated, the migration and invasion of the cells accelerated, but cell apoptosis and proliferation did not changed compared with the control group. Furthermore, the size of the TetTXNIP cells became larger, and the expression level of Vimentin and p-STAT3 increased in the TetTXNIP cells. All the changes mentioned above were opposite in the TXNIP-KO cells. Abnormal expression of TXNIP might be related to the impairment of the GDM placental function, affecting the migration and invasion of the placental trophoblast cells through STAT3 and Vimentin related pathway; thus, TXNIP might be the potential therapeutic target for repairing the placental dysfunction deficient in GDM patients.","",""

We assayed biocharacters and liver function, and used histopathology staining to evaluate the protective effects of FTY-720 against diabetic liver injury. Levels of oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver were observed. mRNA and protein levels of essential enzymes for glucose metabolism were quantified in the liver and the protein expression of TLR4, HIF1α, and NF-κB was determined. In vivo results revealed that FTY-720 significantly lowered blood glucose and lipids, and improved liver function and alleviated liver fibrosis in diabetic mice. FTY-720 reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, with the increased catalase activity and reduced levels of malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, TGF-β and MCP1. Furthermore, FTY-720 modulated glucose metabolism in liver and elevated the ATP production, showing the promotion of glycogenesis and glycolysis and inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Moreover, FTY-720 inhibited the expression of TLR4 and HIF1α, contributing to restoration of liver function. In conclusion, FTY-720 ameliorates diabetes-induced liver injury and improves glucose homeostasis by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation, and may be a promise drug for treatment of liver disease.","",""

We investigated the lycopene intake of adult participants with complete information on clinical variables from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2001 and 2004. Dose-response curve analysis was applied to explore the association between lycopene intake and ED. Logistic regression models were used to adjusted for confounders. Different ethnicities, BMI level, hypertension status, diabetes status and smoking status were analyzed as subgroups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to eliminate the effects of potential confounders to confirm the reliability of the results. A total of 3265 participants with data on lycopene consumption data were included in our study, including 931 individuals with ED and 2334 without ED during NHANES 2001-2004. We found more consumption of lycopene in the non-ED group compared to the ED group. Dose-response curve analysis revealed a significant negative association between lycopene intake and ED prevalence. After adjusting for age, race, cigarette smoking, BMI, annual family income, education, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, depression and testosterone level, we found that increased lycopene intake reduced the odds ratio of ED. Low lycopene intake was positively related to ED in almost all subgroups especially in Mexican American, Non-Hispanic white, BMI<25, hypertension positive, DM negative and smoke negative.

In total, 41 sugarcane leaves-derived compounds were used for the screening of multiple targets. Subsequently, the molecular mechanism and activity validation in vitro of the interaction between enzymes and compound were carried out. As a result, flavonoid compounds schaftoside were identified by molecular simulation and showed significant DPP-IV (0.1050 ± 1.22 mM), α-glucosidase (0.078 ± 0.06 mM) and α-amylase (0.3067 ± 0.35 mM) inhibitory effects.

A 1:1 propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis was applied to patients with and without metabolic syndrome. Demographic and clinical data were analyzed for those cohorts before and after PSM. Metabolic syndrome was defined as BMI ≥ 28.8 kg/m2, diabetes, and hypertension. A total of 272 patients underwent robotic hepatectomy, 39 (14%) of whom had metabolic syndrome. After performing PSM, we ended up with 74 patients, 37 in each cohort, 28% of them had liver cirrhosis. Patients with metabolic syndrome had higher BMI (34 ± 5.6 vs. 28 ± 5.9 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and MELD scores (10 ± 4.5 vs. 8 ± 3.2, p < 0.001) compared to patients without metabolic syndrome. Additionally, patients with metabolic syndrome had an increased incidence of liver cirrhosis (33% vs. 9%, p = 0.0002). Following PSM, BMI (34 ± 5.7 vs. 26 ± 4.4 kg/m2, p < 0.001) was the only preoperative variables associated with metabolic syndrome. There were no statistical differences before and after PSM between patients with and without metabolic syndrome in terms of intraoperative metrics including operative time, blood loss, conversion to 'open,' and intraoperative complications. All postoperative outcomes metrics before and after PSM did not correlate with the presence or absence of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome had no impact on intra- or postoperative metrics, complications, or outcomes after robotic hepatectomy.

Twenty-eight studies mentioned use of health behavior theories in study design or selection of measures. There was heterogeneity in how studies operationalized perceived risk; only one third of studies referenced a theory, model, or framework as guiding design or scale and item selection. Use of perceived lifetime risk, absolute risk, or comparative risk limits comparisons across studies. Consideration of context, target population, and how data are utilized is important when selecting measures; we present a series of questions to ask when selecting measures for use in research and clinical settings. This review is the first to categorize how perceived risk is measured in the diabetes prevention domain; most literature focuses on perceived risk among those with diabetes diagnoses.

The emerging evidence of the early onset of neurological diseases in middle-aged adults (i.e., among the 45-54 age group) reminds us of the need to reinforce a balance between the physical and mental life of individuals. The early onset of chronic diseases in the independent and working-age category (45-54 years) can have many social and economic implications. For instance, it can create a greater healthcare burden when these individuals grow older with these diseases. Further, disease-specific interventions would be helpful in reducing future chronic disease burden.","",""

Prevention and treatment protocols based on a single vascular complication are no longer suitable for the long-term management of patients with diabetes. Diabetic panvascular disease (DPD) is a clinical syndrome in which vessels of various sizes, including macrovessels and microvessels in the cardiac, cerebral, renal, ophthalmic, and peripheral systems of patients with diabetes, develop atherosclerosis as a common pathology. Pathological manifestations of DPDs usually manifest macrovascular atherosclerosis, as well as microvascular endothelial function impairment, basement membrane thickening, and microthrombosis. Cardiac, cerebral, and peripheral microangiopathy coexist with microangiopathy, while renal and retinal are predominantly microangiopathic. The following associations exist between DPDs: numerous similar molecular mechanisms, and risk-predictive relationships between diseases. Aggressive glycemic control combined with early comprehensive vascular intervention is the key to prevention and treatment. In addition to the widely recommended metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, for the latest molecular mechanisms, aldose reductase inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonizts, glucokinases agonizts, mitochondrial energy modulators, etc. are under active development. DPDs are proposed for patients to obtain more systematic clinical care requires a comprehensive diabetes care center focusing on panvascular diseases. This would leverage the advantages of a cross-disciplinary approach to achieve better integration of the pathogenesis and therapeutic evidence. Such a strategy would confer more clinical benefits to patients and promote the comprehensive development of DPD as a discipline.","",""

We observed a cohort of patients with negative immunoblot results and positive ELISA in the context of GAD-associated neurological disease without T1DM.

Pterostilbene is a well-known natural stilbene derivative that has excellent anti-inflammatory activity, suggesting its potential medicinal advantages for treating DCI. Therefore, this study is to explore the beneficial effects of pterostilbene for improving cognitive dysfunction in DCI mice. A diabetic model was induced by a high-fat diet plus streptozotocin (40 mg·kg-1 ) for consecutive 5 days. After the animals were confirmed to be in a diabetic state, they were treated with pterostilbene (20 or 60 mg·kg-1 , i.g.) for 10 weeks. Pharmacological evaluation showed pterostilbene could ameliorate cognitive dysfunction, regulate glycolipid metabolism disorders, improve neuronal damage, and reduce the accumulation of β-amyloid in DCI mice. Pterostilbene alleviated neuroinflammation by suppressing oxidative stress and carbonyl stress damage, astrocyte and microglia activation, and dopaminergic neuronal loss. Further investigations showed that pterostilbene reduced the level of lipopolysaccharide, modulated colon and brain TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways, and decreased the release of inflammatory factors, which in turn inhibited intestinal inflammation and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, pterostilbene could also improve the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota, increase the levels of short-chain fatty acids and their receptors, and suppress the loss of intestinal tight junction proteins. In addition, the results of plasma non-targeted metabolomics revealed that pterostilbene could modulate differential metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with inflammation, thereby suppressing systemic inflammation in DCI mice. Collectively, our study found for the first time that pterostilbene could alleviate diabetic cognitive dysfunction by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-κB pathway through the microbiota-gut-brain axis, which may be one of the potential mechanisms for its neuroprotective effects.","",""

A high proportion of the adolescents were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes during a non-related hospitalisation or medical appointment. Most did not fully understand, nor were aware of the long-term impact of type 2 diabetes. Discussions about diabetes within families did not typically occur, and shame and concealment of their diagnosis was a common finding. Parents described the adolescent's diagnosis of type 2 diabetes as compounding an already challenging set of circumstances for the family. This impacted the parents capacity to encourage and promote self-management activities and attend hospital and outpatient appointments.

In addition, the costs in people with controlled (glycated hemoglobin < 7%) versus uncontrolled glycated hemoglobin (≥ 7%) at time horizons of 1, 5, 10, and 25 years were modeled using the IQVIA Core Diabetes Model. The costs based on the retrospective chart review were $630 versus $1012 (controlled versus uncontrolled population). The modeled costs at various time horizons were as follows: at 1 year, $900 versus $1331; at 5 years, $4163 versus $6423; at 10 years, $7759 versus $16 481; and at 25 years, $16 969 versus $66 268. The largest cost in the controlled population was severe hypoglycemia requiring nonmedical assistance, severe hypoglycemia requiring medical assistance, and treatment costs. In the uncontrolled population, the largest cost was the cost of diabetic ketoacidosis, severe hypoglycemia requiring nonmedical assistance, severe hypoglycemia requiring medical assistance, and foot complications. Strict glycemic control reduces healthcare resource use overall. Patients in the controlled group still experienced high resource use related to hypoglycemic events. The introduction of a structured patient education program and analog insulins may result in less episodes of hypoglycemia and potential cost savings.","",""

This approach helps to identify and address root causes and barriers to patients' health, and provides them with a sense of agency in healthcare. To develop such strategies for migrant patients, there should be a deeper understanding of their situation. Objective: To understand healthcare gaps and opportunities for enhancing diabetes and obesity care for immigrant and refugee populations in primary care. Study Design, Setting and Population Studied: A community-based research, involving 3 qualitative studies conducted in Edmonton, Alberta. Study participants were: 1) members of ethnocultural communities with diabetes and/or obesity; 2) Multicultural Health Brokers (MCHB) - community health workers (CHW) in these communities; and 3) Healthcare providers (HCP). Data set and Analysis: We generated data through interviews and focus groups. Community member (CM) study had 3 focus groups (two groups of 8 males & females (mixed); one of 13 females); and 22 interviews (5 males, 8 females). MCHB study had 10 interviews (females) and 2 observation sessions. HCP study had 4 focus groups (two groups of 6; 2 groups of 8 mixed) and 9 interviews (2 males, 7 females). Data were thematically analyzed. Outcome Measures: CM study explored lived experiences of diabetes and obesity. HCP study examined experiences with caring for patients with diabetes and obesity from ethnocultural communities. MCHB study examined broker roles in relation to primary care. Results: CM study showed that pre- and post-immigration stressors interact synergistically with the lived experience of diabetes and obesity thereby compounding the adverse disease effects. HCP study showed significant challenges navigating cultural distance and trying to address the non-medical issues of migrant patients. MCHB study illustrated their embeddedness in ethnocultural communities playing an invaluable but largely unrecognized role as partners in primary healthcare. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the challenges of intercultural care in primary care settings. CHWs like the MCHB can provide context for healthcare providers, thereby supporting a personalized and context-informed care that understands the intersecting realities of migrant populations. Collaborations with CHWs in primary care have widespread implications for improving healthcare and reducing health disparities for migrants with diabetes and/or obesity.","",""

This research reviewed the cognitive function of 35 diabetic patients, 33 non-diabetic patients and the serum levels of Undercarboxylated osteocalcin (ucOC) in patients. What's more, we analyzed the correlation between serum ucOC levels and cognitive function. Diabetic rats were treated with high (30 μg·kg-1·d-1) and low (10 μg·kg-1·d-1) doses of ucOC to investigate its effects in regulating ucOC on blood lipid, blood glucose and cognitive function. We systematically detected the phosphorylation levels of cognitive level-related proteins (PI3K, AKT, and GSK/3β) in the hippocampus by Western Blot. Finally, PI3K-Akt pathway involved in regulating cognitive function in diabetic rats by ucOC was verified with AKT pathway inhibitor LY294002. MoCA score and serum ucOC levels were significantly reduced in patients with diabetes mellitus. ucOC could concentration-dose-dependently decrease the blood glucose and lipid levels, and improve glucose metabolism and weaken insulin resistance in diabetic rats (P < 0.001). In addition, escape latency in diabetic rats was significantly higher than that of normal rats in the Morris maze test, and ucOC dose-dependently shortened the escape latency in diabetic rats (all with P < 0.05). After using AKT pathway inhibitor, ucOC failed to shorten the escape latency in diabetic rats. In conclusion, this study explored the relevant mechanisms in inducing cognitive dysfunction of T2DM, suggesting the potential value of ucOC as a drug to improve cognitive dysfunction in patients with T2DM in clinical.","",""

Limited research has captured long-term outcomes after pelvic fractures in women of childbearing age. This study aimed to determine the association between pelvic fractures and rates of C-section, SD, and GD. All women of childbearing age who sustained a pelvic fracture were identified in a national insurance database. A comparison group of patients with lower extremity long-bone fractures was selected. Patients who gave birth after injury were additionally identified. A minimum of 5 years of follow-up was required for inclusion. Rates of C-section, SD, and GD were compared between cohorts. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted with the inclusion of diabetes, tobacco, hypertension, obesity, and advanced maternal age. A total of 6,174 patients with pelvic fracture and 27,154 control fracture patients were identified. 434 patients with pelvic fracture (7.0%) and 1,258 control fracture patients (4.6%) gave birth after fracture. Patients with pelvic fracture had a significantly higher rate of C-section (50.0% versus 38.8%, P < 0.001), SD diagnosis (10.9% versus 8.8%, P < 0.001), and urinary retention diagnosis (3.5% versus 2.8%, P < 0.001). No significant difference in global GD diagnosis was identified. Multivariate analyses showed that pelvic fracture was associated with C-section (odds ratio [OR]: 1.78; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.42 to 2.23, P < 0.001), SD diagnosis (OR: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.12 to 1.35, P < 0.001), and urinary retention diagnosis (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.57, P < 0.001). Pelvic fractures confer an intrinsic level of risk of C-section, SD, and urinary retention that is elevated beyond what would be expected from a traumatic lower extremity injury alone. Treating orthopaedic surgeons should actively counsel women regarding increased risks, openly discuss postinjury sequelae, and coordinate interspecialty care beyond initial treatment of acute trauma.","",""

This study sought to decipher the potential effect and molecular mechanism of sinomenine in the cognitive dysfunction following type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Multi-omics analysis was conducted to identify the microbiota-gut-brain axis in T2DM patient samples obtained from the publicly available database. In HT-22 cells, erastin was utilized to create a ferroptosis model, and streptozotocin was injected intraperitoneally to create a rat model of DM. It was noted that intestinal flora imbalance occurred in patients with T2DM-associated cognitive dysfunction. Sinomenine could reduce Erastin-induced hippocampus neuronal ferroptosis by increasing EGF expression. EGF protected hippocampal neurons against ferroptosis by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, in vivo results confirmed that sinomenine blocked ferroptosis of hippocampal neurons and alleviated cognitive dysfunction in T2DM rats. Collectively, these results suggest that sinomenine confers neuroprotective effects by curtailing hippocampal neuron ferroptosis via the EGF/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling and microbiota-gut-brain axis.

We further performed decision curve analyses to assess the clinical usefulness.Overall, 56,831 prediabetic individuals were included, of which 4,303 incident CVD events occurred within a median follow-up of 8.9 years. All the 11 risk scores assessed had modest C-statistics for discrimination ranging from 0.647 to 0.680 in prediabetes. Scores developed in the general population did not outperform those diabetes-specific models (C-statistics 0.647-0.675 vs. 0.647-0.680), while the PREDICT-1° Diabetes equation developed for type 2 diabetes performed best [0.680 (95% confidence interval 0.672-0.689)]. The calibration plots suggested overall poor calibration except that the PREDICT-1° Diabetes equation calibrated well after recalibration. The decision curves generally indicated moderate clinical usefulness of each model, especially worse within high threshold probabilities. Neither risk stratification schemes for the general population nor those specific for type 2 diabetes performed well in the prediabetic population. The PREDICT-1° Diabetes equation could be a substitute in the absence of better alternatives, rather than the general population-based scores. More precise and targeted risk assessment tools for this population remain to be established.","",""

The BRAVO diabetes model was used to assess costs and outcomes for once-daily Gla-300 versus once-daily IDeg-100 from a US healthcare sector perspective. Baseline clinical data were based on BRIGHT, a 24-week, non-inferiority, randomised control trial comparing Gla-300 and IDeg-100 in adults with T2D sub-optimally controlled with OADs (with or without glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists). Treatment costs were based on doses observed in BRIGHT as well as net prices. Costs associated with complications were based on published literature. Lifetime costs (US$) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were predicted and used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates; extensive scenario and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Overall lifetime medical costs were estimated to be $327,904 and $330,154 for people receiving Gla-300 and IDeg-100, respectively; insulin costs were $43,477 and $44,367, respectively. People receiving Gla-300 gained 8.024 QALYs and 18.55 life-years, while people receiving IDeg-100 gained 7.997 QALYs and 18.52 life-years. Because Gla-300 was associated with a cost-saving of $2250 and 0.027 additional QALYs, it was considered to be dominant compared with IDeg-100.

Data were analysed thematically through an abductive approach using Sekhon et al.'s theoretical framework of acceptability and Greenhalgh et al.'s framework for non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability. Acceptability and adoption of the intervention among HCPs were influenced by 1) skills and technology, 2) values, and 3) organisation. The intervention was experienced as acceptable to HCPs because the dialogue tool, visualising different topics, used in the home visits and digital coaching through the LIVA app were flexible and enabled them to address psychosocial health and personalise goal setting in families. However, delivering asynchronous and non-verbal communication was experienced as straining HCPs' relationship with families, which misaligned with HCPs' values. Establishing a non-judgemental environment was needed to increase intervention acceptability among HCPs towards addressing type 2 diabetes risk after GDM. Increased collaboration between HCPs may have aligned advice and support to families and could have benefitted delivery. When delivering health promotion to women with prior GDM, flexible intervention components which support psychosocial- and mental health topics may increase acceptability and adoption of the intervention among HCPs. HCPs' skills, values and organisational factors should be considered prior and during implementation.","",""

Under physiological conditions these species are involved in different cellular processes such as cellular homeostasis and immune response, while an excessive production of ROS/RNS has been linked to the development of various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. In this context, the naturally occurring dipeptide carnosine has shown the ability to scavenge ROS, counteract lipid peroxidation, and inhibit proteins oxidation. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) have been widely used to produce cosmetics, in wastewater treatment, in food industry, and in healthcare product. As consequence, these NPs are often released into aquatic environments. The Danio rerio (commonly called zebrafish) embryos exposure to TiO2-NPs did not affect the hatching rate, but induced oxidative stress. According to this scenario, in the present study, we first investigated the effects of carnosine exposure and of a sub-toxic administration of TiO2-NPs on the development and survival of zebrafish embryos/larvae measured through the acute embryo toxicity test (FET-Test). Zebrafish larvae represent a useful model to study oxidative stress-linked disorders and to test antioxidant molecules, while carnosine was selected based on its well-known multimodal mechanism of action that includes a strong antioxidant activity. Once the basal effects of carnosine were assessed, we then evaluated its effects on TiO2-NPs-induced oxidative stress in zebrafish larvae, measured in terms of total ROS production (measured with 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate probe) and protein expression by immunohistochemistry of two cellular stress markers, 70 kDa-heat shock protein (Hsp70) and metallothioneins (MTs). We demonstrated that carnosine did not alter the phenotypes of both embryos and larvae of zebrafish at different hours post fertilization. Carnosine was instead able to significantly decrease the enhancement of ROS levels in zebrafish larvae exposed to TiO2-NPs and its antioxidant effect was paralleled by the rescue of the protein expression levels of Hsp70 and MTs. Our results suggest a therapeutic potential of carnosine as a new pharmacological tool in the context of pathologies characterized by oxidative stress such as neurodegenerative disorders.","",""

Adipose tissue (AT) is a major endocrine organ in the human body, with composite cells producing and secreting hormones, cytokines, and non-coding RNAs into the circulation to alter the phenotype of multiple organs, including the heart. Epicardial AT (EAT) is an AT deposit that is in direct contact with the myocardium and can therefore influence cardiac function through both mechanical and molecular means. Moreover, resident and recruited immune cells comprise an important adipose cell type, which can create a pro-inflammatory environment in the context of obesity, potentially contributing to systemic inflammation and cardiomyopathies. New mechanisms of fat-to-heart crosstalk, including those governed by non-coding RNAs and extracellular vesicles, are being investigated to deepen the understanding of this highly common risk factor. In this review, molecular crosstalk between AT and the heart will be discussed, with a focus on endocrine and paracrine signaling, immune cells, inflammatory cytokines, and inter-organ communication through non-coding RNAs.","",""

However, the pathogenic mechanisms of MA have not yet been fully elucidated, and there is no effective treatment. This study aims to study the potential pathogenetic mechanisms of MA and to provide targets for the therapy of MA. Methods: A single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin induced type 1 diabetes in rat models. Subsequently, rats were divided into the control group, the diabetic group without MA, and the diabetic group with MA based on weekly behavioral assays. The differentially expressed lipids in the sciatic nerve of each group were detected using untargeted lipidomics, and the differentially expressed genes in the sciatic nerve of each group were detected by transcriptomics. The pathogenesis of MA was predicted using integrated analysis and validated by immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy. Results: Untargeted lipidomics revealed the accumulation of a more severe lipid in MA rats. Transcriptomics results suggested that differentially expressed genes in MA rats were primarily related to lipid droplets and myelin sheath. Integrated analysis results indicated that the downregulation of Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) expression was closely linked to lipid metabolism disorders. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that down-regulation of CYP1A2 expression occurred in MA rats. Transmission electron microscopy results showed that more severe lipid droplet accumulation and myelin sheath degeneration occurred in MA rats. Conclusion: Our findings imply that the downregulation of CYP1A2 expression leads to disorders of lipid metabolism and further leads to lipid droplet accumulation and myelin sheath degeneration, which might ultimately lead to the development of MA. Therefore, our study contributes to promoting the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of MA and providing potential targets for the clinical treatment of MA.","",""

Statins can significantly improve the prognosis of dyslipidemia, but its side effects cannot be ignored. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used in clinical practice for more than 2000 years in China and has certain traits in treating dyslipidemia with little side effect. Previous research has shown that Mutual Obstruction of Phlegm and Stasis (MOPS) is the most common dyslipidemia type classified in TCM. However, how to compose diagnostic factors in TCM into diagnostic rules relies heavily on the doctor's experience, falling short in standardization and objectiveness. This is a limit for TCM to play its advantages of treating dyslipidemia with MOPS. In this study, the syndrome diagnosis in TCM was transformed into the prediction and classification problem in artificial intelligence The deep learning method was employed to build the classification prediction models for dyslipidemia. The models were built and trained with a large amount of multi-centered clinical data on MOPS. The optimal model was screened out by evaluating the performance of prediction models through loss, accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, PR and ROC curve (including AUC). A total of 20 models were constructed through the deep learning method. All of them performed well in the prediction of dyslipidemia with MOPS. The model-11 is the optimal model. The evaluation indicators of model-11 are as follows: The true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and false negative (FN) are 51, 15, 129, and 9, respectively. The loss is 0.3241, accuracy is 0.8672, precision is 0.7138, recall is 0.8286, and the AUC is 0.9268. After screening through 89 diagnostic factors of TCM, we identified 36 significant diagnosis factors for dyslipidemia with MOPS. The most outstanding diagnostic factors from the importance were dark purple tongue, slippery pulse and slimy fur, etc. This study successfully developed a well-performing classification prediction model for dyslipidemia with MOPS, transforming the syndrome diagnosis problem in TCM into a prediction and classification problem in artificial intelligence. Patients with dyslipidemia of MOPS can be accurately recognized through limited information from patients. We also screened out significant diagnostic factors for composing diagnostic rules of dyslipidemia with MOPS. The study is an avant-garde attempt at introducing the deep-learning method into the research of TCM, which provides a useful reference for the extension of deep learning method to other diseases and the construction of disease diagnosis model in TCM, contributing to the standardization and objectiveness of TCM diagnosis.","",""

Mean arterial pressure is the largest confounding variable to PWV; therefore, in this study we aimed to test the hypothesis that increased aortic PWV in type 2 diabetic mice is driven by increased blood pressure rather than vascular biomechanics. Methods and Results: Using a combination of in vivo PWV and ex vivo pressure myography, our data demonstrate no difference in ex vivo passive mechanics, including outer diameter, inner diameter, compliance (Db/db: 0.0094 ± 0.0018 mm2/mmHg vs. db/db: 0.0080 ± 0.0008 mm2/mmHg, p > 0.05 at 100 mmHg), and incremental modulus (Db/db: 801.52 ± 135.87 kPa vs. db/db: 838.12 ± 44.90 kPa, p > 0.05 at 100 mmHg), in normal versus diabetic 16 week old mice. We further report no difference in basal or active aorta biomechanics in normal versus diabetic 16 week old mice. Finally, we show here that the increase in diabetic in vivo aortic pulse wave velocity at baseline was completely abolished when measured at equivalent pharmacologically-modulated blood pressures, indicating that the elevated PWV was attributed to the concomitant increase in blood pressure at baseline, and therefore ""stiffness."" Conclusions: Together, these animal model data suggest an intimate regulation of blood pressure during collection of pulse wave velocity when determining in vivo vascular stiffness. These data further indicate caution should be exerted when interpreting elevated PWV as the pure marker of vascular stiffness.","",""

The aim of the study is to assess in-hospital mortality and its predictors among DM patients admitted to Jimma Medical Center. A hospital-based prospective observational study was employed involving 120 diabetes patients admitted to JMC from October 01, 2020, to June 30, 2021.

Adult diabetes specialists in 2 academic health systems who recently used video-based telemedicine to provide diabetes care were invited to participate in an online survey study between March and April 2022. Likert-style questions, followed by related open-ended questions, assessed perspectives on availability of key resources, factors affecting quality, and anticipated benefits from telemedicine for diabetes.

Here, we used D-galactose (D-gal) to establish an appropriate model of senescent hBMSCs to explore the antiaging effects of metformin. Following metformin treatment with a low concentration range, senescence phenotypes induced by D-gal significantly changed, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and cell cycle arrest. In contrast, no apparent change was found in unsenescent hBMSCs. Furthermore, the results show that activation of 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by metformin enhances cell autophagy in senescent hBMSCs. These findings suggest that metformin exerts antiaging function within the low concentration range by enhancing autophagy and exhibits potential benefits for clinical stem cell therapy by ameliorating the ex vivo replicative senescence of hBMSCs.","",""

Tongxinluo (TXL) has been widely used for the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and extended for diabetes-related vascular disease. To investigate the effect of TXL on diabetic PAD and its underlying mechanisms. An animal model of diabetic PAD was established by ligating the femoral artery of db/db mice. Laser Doppler imaging and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) were performed to assess the recovery of blood flow and arteriogenesis. Endothelial cell function related to arteriogenesis and cellular pyroptosis was assessed using histopathology, Western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. In vitro, human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were pretreated with TXL for 4 h, followed by incubation in high glucose and hypoxia conditions to induce cell injury. Then, indicators of HUVEC pyroptosis and function, HUVEC-VSMC interactions and the migration of VSMCs were measured. Laser Doppler imaging and micro-CT showed that TXL restored blood flow to the hindlimbs and enhanced arteriogenesis. TXL also inhibited endothelial cell pyroptosis via the reactive oxygen species/nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3/Caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway. In addition, TXL restored endothelial cell functions, including maintaining the balance of vasodilation, acting as a barrier to reduce inflammation, and enhancing endothelial-smooth muscle cell interactions through the Jagged-1/Notch-1/ephrin-B2 signaling pathway. Similar results were observed in vitro. TXL has a pro-arteriogenic effect in the treatment of diabetic PAD, and the mechanism may be related to the inhibition of endothelial cell pyroptosis, restoration of endothelial cell function and promotion of endothelial cell-smooth muscle cell interactions.","",""

In addition to glycation and oxidation, carbamylation is also a post-translational modification affecting lipoproteins in diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) exhibit higher levels of carbamylated low-density lipoproteins (cLDL) and high-density lipoproteins (cHDL). Accumulating evidence suggests that cLDL plays a role in atherosclerosis in diabetes. cLDL levels have been shown to predict cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. cLDL facilitates immune cell recruitment in the vascular wall, promotes accumulation of lipids in macrophages, and contributes to endothelial dysf-unction, endothelial nitric oxide-synthase (eNOS) inactivation and endothelial repair defects. Lastly, cLDL induces thrombus formation and platelet aggregation. On the other hand, recent data have demonstrated that cHDL serum level is independently associated with all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality in T2D patients. This relationship may be causative since the atheroprotective properties of HDL are altered after carbamylation. Thus, cHDL loses the ability to remove cholesterol from macrophages, to inhibit monocyte adhesion and recruitment, to induce eNOS activation and to inhibit apoptosis. Taken together, it seems very likely that the abnormalities in the biological functions of LDL and HDL after carbamylation contribute to atherosclerosis and to the elevated cardiovascular risk in diabetes.","",""

We have previously shown that IR FKO mice have profound insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and whitenng of interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT), closely mimicking the phenotypes in lipoatrophic diabetic patients. Here, we demonstrate that 14-day of LPD (5.1% kcal from protein) feeding is sufficient to reduce postprandial blood glucose, improve insulin resistance, and normalize glucose tolerance in the IR FKO mice. This profound metabolic improvement is associated with BAT activation and increase in whole body energy expenditure. To confirm, we showed that surgical denervation of BAT attenuated the beneficial metabolic effects of LPD feeding in IR FKO mice, including the 'browning' effects on BAT and the glucose-ameliorating results. However, BAT denervation failed to affect the body weight-lowering effects of LPD. Together, our results imply a therapeutic potential to use LPD for the treatment of lipoatrophic diabetes.","",""

In response to this emerging challenge, we aimed to characterize the spatial structure of convergence of chronic health conditions in a HIV hyperendemic community in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We utilized data from a comprehensive population-based disease survey conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, which collected data on HIV, diabetes, and hypertension. We implemented a novel health needs scale to categorize participants as: diagnosed and well-controlled (Needs Score 1), diagnosed and sub-optimally controlled (Score 2), diagnosed but not engaged in care (Score 3), or undiagnosed and uncontrolled (Score 4). Scores 2-4 were indicative of unmet health needs. We explored the geospatial structure of unmet health needs using different spatial clustering methods. The analytical sample comprised of 18,041 individuals. We observed a similar spatial structure for HIV among those with a combined needs Score 2-3 (diagnosed but uncontrolled) and Score 4 (undiagnosed and uncontrolled), with most PLHIV with unmet needs clustered in the southern peri-urban area, which was relatively densely populated within the surveillance area. Multivariate clustering analysis revealed a significant overlap of all three diseases in individuals with undiagnosed and uncontrolled diseases (unmet needs Score 4) in the southern part of the catchment area. In a HIV hyperendemic community in South Africa, areas with the highest needs for PLHIV with undiagnosed and uncontrolled disease are also areas with the highest burden of unmet needs for other chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension. The identification and prioritization of geographically clustered vulnerable communities with unmet health needs for both HIV and non-communicable diseases provide a basis for policy and implementation strategies to target communities with the highest health needs.

There is also emerging evidence of an association between obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) which is less well characterized. A literature search of electronic libraries was conducted to identify and present a narrative review of the interplay between obesity and CKD. Obesity may predispose to CKD directly as it is linked to the histopathological finding of obesity-related glomerulopathy and indirectly through its widely recognized complications such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The biochemical and endocrine products of adipose tissue contribute to pathophysiological processes such as inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and proteinuria. The prevention and management of obesity may prove critical in counteracting both the development and advancement of CKD. Moreover, measures of abdominal adiposity such as waist circumference, are generally associated with worse morbidity and mortality in individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis. Obesity is a risk factor for the onset and progression of CKD and should be recognized as a potential target for a preventative public health approach to reduce CKD rates within the general population. Future research should focus on the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with CKD and obesity due to their multi-faceted actions on major outcomes.","",""

The lifestyle intervention involves a one-hour virtual educational program (to take place at 32-36 weeks gestation). Postpartum, the intervention will include monthly phone calls, weekly motivational text messages, weekly step counts, and referral for three months to a Commercial Weight Management Organization (Slimming World). The control arm will receive usual care as offered by the local maternity hospital. The primary outcome is weight loss at 12 months postpartum. Study visits for anthropometric and clinical measurements, fasting blood samples, questionnaires pertaining to health, wellbeing and physical activity will take place at 6 weeks, 6- and 12-months postpartum. Focus groups will be conducted with intervention mothers' post-intervention to determine the acceptability of the study design including utility of a Commercial Weight Management Organization, feasibility of remote patient contact, family involvement and patient satisfaction.

Many important research commentaries and reviews have been provided to describe the various contributions and scientific breakthroughs that led to the development of COVID-19 vaccines. In this work, we sought to complement those efforts by adding a systematic and quantitative study of the research foundations that led to these vaccines. Here, we analyzed citations from COVID-19 vaccine research articles to determine which scientific areas of study contributed the most to this research. Our findings revealed that coronavirus research was cited most often, and by a large margin. However, significant contributions were also seen from a diverse set of fields such as cancer, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. In addition, we examined the publication history of the most prolific authors of COVID-19 vaccine research to determine their research expertise prior to the pandemic. Interestingly, although COVID-19 vaccine research relied most heavily on previous coronavirus work, we find that the most prolific authors on these publications most often had expertise in other areas including influenza, cancer, and HIV/AIDS. Finally, we used machine learning to identify and group together publications based on their major topic areas. This allowed us to elucidate the differences in citations between research areas. These findings highlight and quantify the relevance of prior research from a variety of scientific fields to the rapid development of a COVID-19 vaccine. This study also illustrates the importance of funding and sustaining a diverse research enterprise to facilitate a rapid response to future pandemics.","",""

In this qualitative study, we explore WLHIVs' experiences of using IUC and reasons for discontinuation. This qualitative study included in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 17 WLHIV who electively discontinued their allocated IUC while participating in a randomized controlled trial comparing the safety of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and the copper intrauterine device (C-IUD) in Cape Town, South Africa. The transcripts were coded and emergent themes were grouped to examine women's experiences with IUC use and reasons for discontinuation, highlighting experiential differences between the two methods. Women's experience with the allocated IUC related most commonly to bleeding and/or abdominal pain just after insertion. Most C-IUD discontinuers, but only one LNG-IUS discontinuer, complained of pain and/or increased bleeding as the main reason for removal. Three women (two LNG-IUS, one C-IUD) requested removal because they desired pregnancy, while two others discontinued due to fears the IUC was exacerbating non-gynecologic conditions (hypertension, diabetes). Generally, women acknowledged advantages of IUC use and many expressed their desire to continue use if not for the side effects. In the South African context, IUC use for WLHIV should be promoted with specific counseling considerations. Both providers and potential users should receive specific information about potential menstrual-related side effects and countering common misperceptions to enable informed contraceptive decision-making.","",""

Most epidemiological studies have shown a potential protective role of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the prevalence and incidence of AAA. The effect of DM on AAA might be explained mainly by two factors: hyperglycemia [or other DM-related factors such as insulin resistance (IR)] and/or by the effect of prescribed DM drugs, which may have a direct or indirect effect on the formation and progression of AAAs. However, recent studies further support that the protective role of DM in AAA may be attributable to antidiabetic therapies (i.e.: metformin or SGLT-2 inhibitors).

The primary outcome was MACEs arising from untreated NCLs during the follow-up. The association between plaque characteristics detected by CCTA and primary outcomes was determined by Marginal Cox proportional hazard regression. Overall, 1,248 NCLs of the 523 patients were analyzed and followed up for a median of 47 months. The cumulative rates of indeterminate, CL, and NCL-related MACEs were 2.3%, 14.5%, and 20.5%, respectively.

Between January 2014 and December 2017, we continually gathered data on 595 patients with suspected CAD who received cycling exercise stress MPS. HRR at 1, 2, 3, and 4 min were used as study variables to obtain the optimal cut-off values of HRR for MACE. The difference between the peak heart rate achieved during exercise and the heart rate at 1, 2, 3, and 4 min was used to calculate the HRR, as shown in HRR3. Heart rate variations between two locations in time, such as HRR2 min-1 min, were used to establish the slope of HRR. All patients were followed for a minimum of 4 years, with MACE as the follow-up goal. The associations between HRR and MACE were assessed using Cox proportional hazards analyses. Patients with MACE were older (P = 0.001), and they also had higher rates of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, abnormal MPS findings (SSS ≥ 5%), medication history (all P < 0.001), and lower HRR values (all P < 0.01). Patients with and without MACE did not significantly vary in their HRR4 min-3 min. The optimal cut-off of HRR1, 2, and 3 combined with SSS can stratify the risk of MACE in people with suspected CAD (all P < 0.001). HRR 1, 2, and 3 and its slope were linked to MACE in multivariate analysis, where HRR3 was the most significant risk predictor. With a global X2 increase from 101 to 126 (P < 0.0001), HRR3 demonstrated the greatest improvement in the model's predictive capacity, incorporating clinical data and MPS outcomes. HRR at 3 min has a more excellent incremental prognostic value for predicting MACE in patients with suspected CAD following cycling exercise stress MPS. Therefore, incorporating HRR at 3 min into known predictive models may further improve the risk stratification of the patients.","",""

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from adipose-derived stem cells have shown effectiveness in diabetic wound models. However, obtaining ADSC-EVs requires culturing vast numbers of cells, which is hampered by the need for expensive equipment and reagents, extended time cost, and complicated procedures before commercialization. Therefore, methods to extract EVs from discarded tissue need to be developed, for immediate application during surgery. For this reason, mechanical, collagenase-digestive, and constant in-vitro-collective methods were designed and compared for preparing therapy-grade EVs directly from adipose tissue. Methods: Characteristics and quantities of EVs were detected by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and Western blotting firstly. To investigate the biological effects of EVs on diabetic wound healing, angiogenesis, proliferation, migration, and inflammation-regulation assays were then evaluated in vitro, along with a diabetic wound healing mouse model in vivo. To further explore the potential therapeutic mechanism of EVs, miRNA expression profile of EVs were also identified and analyzed. Results: The adipose tissue derived EVs (AT-EVs) were showed to qualify ISEV identification by nanoparticle tracking analysis and Western blotting and the AT-EVs yield from three methods was equal. EVs also showed promoting effects on biological processes related to diabetic wound healing, which depend on fibroblasts, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. We also observed enrichment of overlapping or unique miRNAs originate from different types of AT-EVs associated with diabetic wound healing for further investigation. Conclusion: After comparative analyses, a mechanical method was proposed for preparing immediate clinical applicable EVs from adipose tissue that would result in reduced preparation time and lower cost, which could have promising application potential in treating diabetic wounds.","",""

GK rats also showed significant delays in flicker and oscillatory potential implicit times (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001) beginning at 1 month. Cognitive deficits were observed beginning at 6 months (p < 0.05), but no motor deficits. GK rats showed no deficits in functional hyperemia and no increase in acellular retinal capillaries. Dopamine levels were twice as high in GK vs. Wistar retinas at 1, 2, 8, and 12 months (p < 0.001). As shown previously, retinal deficits were detectable prior to cognitive deficits in GK rats. While retinal neuronal function was compromised, retinal vascular pathology was not observed, even at 12+ months. High endogenous levels of dopamine in the GK rat may be acting as an anti-angiogenic and providing protection against vascular pathology.","",""

Despite the recent progress in ankle arthroplasty surgery, ankle arthrodesis is still considered the gold-standard treatment for severe osteoarthritis of the ankle joint and can achieve impressive improvements in pain and function in the majority of patients. Our objective is to assess the clinical and functional outcomes of ankle arthrodesis, postoperative complications, and patient satisfaction. Methodology This was a descriptive cross-sectional study that took place at Future Hospital in Khartoum, Sudan, from July 2015 to July 2022. Our institute performed 102 ankle fusion surgeries; 14 patients were excluded from the study because they did not show up for their follow-up visit, meaning 88 candidates were included. Two cannulated screws (6.5 mm) were used for ankle fixation in all patients. The outcome was assessed two years after surgery. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score was used to assess ankle function before surgery and two years after the procedure. Postoperative complications and patient satisfaction were reported. The primary researcher collected data through direct interviews. Result The mean age of the study participants was 52.2 years, with 36.4% being between 40 and 50 years of age. The study consisted of 43 women and 45 men. The male-to-female ratio was almost 1:1. In 56.8% of candidates, the right ankle was involved. The overall rate of complications was 11.4%. Concerning patient satisfaction, 75% of the patients were fully satisfied. Moreover, significant correlations were found between the mean postoperative AOFAS score and age group, diabetes mellitus, complications, and patient satisfaction. Conclusion Ankle arthrodesis was demonstrated to be an excellent surgical method for reducing pain and enhancing ankle joint function. The most frequent complications were delayed wound healing, infection, and non-union. The functional outcome and patient satisfaction of this procedure were statistically high; patients with a higher functional score had higher levels of satisfaction. In contrast, diabetic and elderly patients had higher rates of complications.","",""

We integrated seven DCRGs into the DCIN and analyzed their role in different tumors from various perspectives. We also investigated drug sensitivity and single-cell sequencing data in colon adenocarcinoma as an example. In addition, we performed in vitro experiments to verify the expression of DCRGs and the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway. Seven identified DCRGs, including PPARG, MMP9, CTNNB1, TNF, TGFB1, PTGS2, and HIF1A, were integrated to construct a DCIN. The bioinformatics analysis showed that the expression of the seven DCRGs in different tumors was significantly different, which had varied effects on diverse perspectives. Single-cell sequencing analyzed in colon cancer showed that the activity of the DCRGs was highest in Macrophage and the lowest in B cells among all cell types in adenoma and carcinoma tissue. In vitro experiments showed that the DCRGs verified by western bolt and PEG2 verified by ELISA were all highly expressed in COAD epithelial cells stimulated by high glucose. This study, for the first time, constructed a DCIN, which provides novel insights into the underlying mechanism of how DM increases tumor occurrence and development.

Two maternal provisions include early microbial colonizers to initiate microbiota establishment and the transfer of antibodies from mother to baby. Maternal antibodies are a result of a lifetime of antigenic experience, reflecting the infection history, health and environmental exposure of the mother. These same factors are strong influencers of the microbiota, inexorably linking the two. Together, these provisions help to educate the developing neonatal immune system and shape lymphocyte repertoires, establishing a role for external environmental influences even before birth. In the context of autoimmunity, the transfer of maternal autoantibodies has the potential to be harmful for the child, sometimes targeting tissues and cells with devastating consequences. Curiously, this does not seem to apply to maternal autoantibody transfer in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Moreover, despite the rising prevalence of the disease, little research has been conducted on the effects of maternal dysbiosis or antibody transfer from an affected mother to her offspring and thus their relevance to disease development in the offspring remains unclear. This review seeks to provide a thorough evaluation of the role of maternal microorganisms and antibodies within the context of T1D, exploring both their pathogenic and protective potential. Although a definitive understanding of their significance in infant T1D development remains elusive at present, we endeavor to present what has been learned with the goal of spurring further interest in this important and intriguing question.","",""

There is no cure for DR, and medical interventions marginally slow the progression of disease. Microglia-mediated inflammation in the diabetic retina is regulated via CX3CR1-FKN signaling, where FKN serves as a calming signal for microglial activation in several neuroinflammatory models. Polymorphic variants of CX3CR1, hCX3CR1I249/M280 , found in 25% of the human population, result in a receptor with lower binding affinity for FKN. Furthermore, disrupted CX3CR1-FKN signaling in CX3CR1-KO and FKN-KO mice leads to exacerbated microglial activation, robust neuronal cell loss and substantial vascular damage in the diabetic retina. Thus, studies to characterize the effects of hCX3CR1I249/M280 -expression in microglia-mediated inflammation in the diseased retina are relevant to identify mechanisms by which microglia contribute to disease progression. Our results show that hCX3CR1I249/M280 mice are significantly more susceptible to microgliosis and production of Cxcl10 and TNFα under acute inflammatory conditions. Inflammation is exacerbated under diabetic conditions and coincides with robust neuronal loss in comparison to CX3CR1-WT mice. Therefore, to further investigate the role of hCX3CR1I249/M280 -expression in microglial responses, we pharmacologically depleted microglia using PLX-5622, a CSF-1R antagonist. PLX-5622 treatment led to a robust (~70%) reduction in Iba1+ microglia in all non-diabetic and diabetic mice. CSF-1R antagonism in diabetic CX3CR1-WT prevented TUJ1+ axonal loss, angiogenesis and fibrinogen deposition. In contrast, PLX-5622 microglia depletion in CX3CR1-KO and hCX3CR1I249/M280 mice did not alleviate TUJ1+ axonal loss or angiogenesis. Interestingly, PLX-5622 treatment reduced fibrinogen deposition in CX3CR1-KO mice but not in hCX3CR1I249/M280 mice, suggesting that hCX3CR1I249/M280 expressing microglia influences vascular pathology differently compared to CX3CR1-KO microglia. Currently CX3CR1-KO mice are the most commonly used strain to investigate CX3CR1-FKN signaling effects on microglia-mediated inflammation and the results in this study indicate that hCX3CR1I249/M280 receptor variants may serve as a complementary model to study dysregulated CX3CR1-FKN signaling. In summary, the protective effects of microglia depletion is CX3CR1-dependent as microglia depletion in CX3CR1-KO and hCX3CR1I249/M280 mice did not alleviate retinal degeneration nor microglial morphological activation as observed in CX3CR1-WT mice.","",""

The present review presents the underlying causes and provides a thorough algorithm for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia in stroke patients. Concomitant diseases and therapies, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart failure, along with diuretics, antidepressants and proton pump inhibitors are the most common causes of hyponatraemia in community. In the setting of acute stroke, the emergence of hyponatraemia might be attributed to the administration of hypotonic solutions and drugs (ie. mannitol and antiepileptics), poor solute intake, infections, as well as stroke-related conditions or complications, such as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, cerebral salt wasting syndrome and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Diagnostically, the initial step is to differentiate hypotonic from non-hypotonic hyponatraemia, usually caused by hyperglycaemia or recent mannitol administration in patients with stroke. Determining urine osmolality, urine sodium level and volume status are the following steps in the differentiation of hypotonic hyponatraemia. Of note, specific parameters, such as fractional uric acid and urea excretion, along with plasma copeptin concentration, may further improve the diagnostic yield. Therapeutic options are based on the duration and symptoms of hyponatremia. In the case of acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia, hypertonic saline administration is recommended. Hypovolaemic chronic hyponatremia is treated with isotonic solution administration. Although fluid restriction remains the first-line treatment for the rest forms of chronic hyponatraemia, therapies increasing renal free water excretion may be necessary. Loop diuretics and urea serve this purpose in patients with stroke, whereas sodium-glucose transport protein-2 inhibitors appear to be a promising therapy. Nevertheless, it is yet unclear whether the appropriate restoration of sodium level improves outcomes in such patients. Randomized trials designed to compare therapeutic strategies in managing hyponatraemia in patients with stroke are required.","",""

C. odorata has been reported as having α-glucosidase, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. Its effectiveness in preventing cardiometabolic syndrome has not yet been assessed. This study aims to investigate the potential efficacy of C. odorata and coumarin for characteristic features of cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS), including obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension by using high-refined carbohydrate-high fat-cholesterol (HRCHFC)-loaded feed-fed rats. Chronic administration of C. odorata and coumarin for 6 weeks revealed a marked attenuation in body and organ weights, with a consistent decline in feed intake compared to HRCHFC diet fed rats. The test materials also caused a significant reduction in the blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean) and heart rate of HRCHFC-diet fed rats. Improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity tests were also observed in test material administered rats compare to only HRCHFC-diet fed rats. C. odorata and coumarin-treated animals produced a marked decline in serum FBG, TC, TG, LFTs, and RFTs, while an increase in serum HDL-C levels was noticed. C. odorata and coumarin also significantly modulated inflammatory biomarkers (TNFα, IL-6), adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, and chemerin), and HMG-CoA reductase levels, indicating prominent anti-inflammatory, cholesterol-lowering, and anti-hyperglycemic potential. Administration of C. odorata and coumarin exhibited a marked improvement in oxidative stress markers (CAT, SOD, and MDA). Histopathological analysis of liver, heart, kidney, pancreas, aorta, and fat tissues showed a revival of normal tissue architecture in C. odorata and coumarin-treated rats compared to only HRCHFC-diet fed rats. These results suggest that C. odorata and coumarin possess beneficial effects against the characteristic features of CMS (obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) in HRCHFC feed-administered rats. These effects were possibly mediated through improved adipokines, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity, the attenuation of HMG-CoA reductase and inflammatory biomarkers, and modulated oxidative stress biomarkers.

Ondansetron (1.0 mg/kg i.p.), naloxone (3.0 mg/kg i.p.) and yohimbine (2.0 mg/kg i.p.) were used to elucidate the possible mechanism involved. Postmortem frontal cortical, striatal and hippocampal tissues were dissected and evaluated for changes in levels of dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection. Results: Acute administration of 1MeTIQ (15-45 mg/kg i.p.) reversed streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathic static mechanical allodynia (von Frey filament pressure test) and thermal hyperalgesia (tail immersion test), these outcomes being comparable to standard gabapentin. Furthermore, HPLC analysis revealed that STZ-diabetic mice expressed lower concentrations of serotonin in all three brain regions examined, while dopamine was diminished in the striatum and 1MeTIQ reversed all these neurotransmitter modifications. These findings suggest that the antihyperalgesic/antiallodynic activity of 1MeTIQ may be mediated in part via supraspinal opioidergic and monoaminergic modulation since they were naloxone, yohimbine and ondansetron reversible. Conclusion: It was also concluded that acute treatment with 1MeTIQ ameliorated STZ-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia and restored brain regionally altered serotonin and dopamine concentrations which signify a potential for 1MeTIQ in the management of DPN.","",""

Herbal medicines are medicinal materials or preparations derived from plants and are widely used in the treatment of metabolic diseases due to their good curative effects and minimal side effects. Recent studies have shown that gut microbiota plays an important role in the herbal treatment of metabolic diseases. However, the mechanisms involved are still not fully understood. This review provides a timely and comprehensive summary of the interactions between herbal medicines and gut microbiota in metabolic diseases. Mechanisms by which herbal medicines treat metabolic diseases include their effects on the gut microbial composition, the intestinal barrier, inflammation, and microbial metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids and bile acids). Herbal medicines can increase the abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Akkermansia and Blautia), reduce the abundance of harmful bacteria (e.g., Escherichia-Shigella), protect the intestinal barrier, and alleviate inflammation. In turn, gut microbes can metabolize herbal compounds and thereby increase their bioavailability and bioactivity, in addition to reducing their toxicity. These findings suggest that the therapeutic effects of herbal medicines on metabolic diseases are closely related to their interactions with the gut microbiota. In addition, some methods, and techniques for studying the bidirectional interaction between herbal medicines and gut microbiota are proposed and discussed. The information presented in this review will help with a better understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of herbal medicines and the key role of gut microbiota.","",""

Patients with T2DM are more likely to have carotid atherosclerosis (CAS), which can lead to dizziness, amaurosis or even stroke. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has shown possible efficacy and safety in treating T2DM patients with CAS. However, the existing evidence was not robust enough and the results were out of date. Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the current evidence and systematically evaluate the effects of CHM on carotid plaque, glucose and lipid metabolism and vascular endothelial parameters in T2DM patients with CAS, providing a reference for subsequent research and clinical practice. Methods: This study was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42022346274. Both Chinese and English databases were searched from their inceptions to 16 July 2022. All retrieved studies were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using oral CHM to treat T2DM patients with CAS were included. The literature quality was assessed using the risk of bias assessment tool in the Cochrane Handbook. Data extraction was conducted on the selected studies. Review Manager 5.4 and Stata 16.0 were used for meta-analysis. Sources of heterogeneity were explored by meta-regression or subgroup analysis. Funnel plot and Egger's test were used to assess publication bias and the evidence quality was assessed by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Results: 27 eligible studies, involving 2638 patients, were included in this study. Compared with western medicine (WM) alone, the addition of CHM was significantly better in improving carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) [mean difference (MD) = -0.11mm, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.15 to -0.07, p < 0.01], carotid plaque Crouse score [MD = -1.21, 95%CI: -1.35 to -1.07, p < 0.01], total cholesterol (TC) [MD = -0.34 mmol/L, 95%CI: -0.54 to -0.14, p < 0.01], triglyceride (TG) [MD = -0.26 mmol/L, 95%CI: -0.37 to -0.15, p < 0.01], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [MD = -0.36 mmol/L, 95%CI: -0.47 to -0.25, p < 0.01], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) [MD = 0.22 mmol/L, 95%CI: 0.13 to 0.30, p < 0.01], glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) [MD = -0.36%, 95%CI: -0.51 to -0.21, p < 0.01], fasting blood glucose (FBG) [MD = -0.33 mmol/L, 95%CI: -0.50 to -0.16, p < 0.01], 2-h postprandial glucose (2hPG) [MD = -0.52 mmol/L, 95%CI: -0.95 to -0.09, p < 0.01], homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.88, 95%CI: -1.36 to -0.41, p < 0.01] and homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-β) [MD = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.51 to 1.09, p < 0.01]. Due to the small number of included studies, it is unclear whether CHM has an improving effect on nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), peak systolic velocity (PSV) and resistance index (RI). No serious adverse events were observed. Conclusion: Based on this meta-analysis, we found that in the treatment of T2DM patients with CAS, combined with CHM may have more advantages than WM alone, which can further reduce CIMT and carotid plaque Crouse score, regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, improve insulin resistance and enhance islet β-cell function. Meanwhile, CHM is relatively safe. However, limited by the quality and heterogeneity of included studies, the efficacy and safety of CHM remain uncertain. More high-quality studies are still needed to provide more reliable evidence for the clinical application of CHM.

Methods: Studies published in Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and Embase up to May 2022 were identified according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The primary assessed outcomes were the medication possession ratio (MPR) and proportion of days covered (PDC). We investigated the probability of being adherent to the prescribed treatment (MPR or PDC ≥80%) or the average estimate of these two parameters. Studies reporting such results were included in this meta-analysis. The summary measures were reported as the risk ratio (RR) and the weighted mean difference (MD) with 95% of confidence interval (CI) using the random-effects model of DerSimonian and Laird. The quality of the cohort studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: Of the 1,814 screened studies, 61 met the predefined inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of the results showed that compared to FEC, FDC significantly improved the medication compliance of patients by 1.29 times (95% CI:1.23-1.35, p < 0.00001). I2 of 99% represent high heterogeneity across studies. The mean difference in medication adherence between FDC and FEC was 0.10 (95% CI: 0.06-0.14, p < 0.00001) with an I2 estimate of 100%. Subgroup analyses were performed for studies that reported adherence outcomes according to disease type, period of evaluation and compliance indicators. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to exclude the results of low-quality studies, as well as studies in which there was ambiguity in the method of calculating the estimator. Conclusion: Analysis of the assessed parameters for the intention-to-treat and subgroup populations suggests that FDC can improve adherence to treatment and its advantages over FEC may increase over time. Further research is needed to better understand how medical conditions affect the impact of reduced pill burden on adherence, particularly in diseases other than cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.","",""

Gastroparesis is associated with psychological dysfunction, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is known to be a prevalent and chronic manifestation of anxiety, which has been increasing in prevalence since the year 2020. Despite the association between gastroparesis and GAD, there has been limited research on the possible impact GAD may have on the morbidity and mortality of patients hospitalized for gastroparesis, which is further evaluated in this study.   Methods   Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the year 2014, a retrospective study was conducted to assess the outcomes of hospitalized gastroparesis patients with and without a history of GAD. In this study, the analyzed outcomes included acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory failure, sepsis, acute deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, intestinal obstruction, and inpatient mortality. To assess whether GAD is an independent risk factor for the outcomes, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was used.   Results   There were 22,150 patients with gastroparesis assessed in this study; GAD was found to be a comorbid diagnosis in 4,196 of those patients.

The adjusted odds ratios for acute respiratory failure, sepsis, acute deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, intestinal obstruction, and inpatient mortality did not meet the threshold for statistical significance.   Conclusion   In hospitalized gastroparesis patients, GAD is a risk factor for AKI. This finding may be attributed to prerenal azotemia due to an increased risk of nausea and vomiting associated with GAD, as well as the medications used to treat GAD such as escitalopram and duloxetine. In addition, the dual inflammatory states caused by the co-existence of both GAD and gastroparesis may also have a role in increasing the risk for AKI.

The liver is considered a key organ in the reciprocal relationship between AD and metabolic syndrome and is the major organ for the clearance of Aβ in the periphery.

The incidence of T2DM in elderly females with hypertension who were uneducated and with a handgrip strength of <17.350 kg was 24.3% (115 cases), whereas that in elderly females with hypertension and a relative handgrip strength of <0.240 was 29.0% (127 cases). According to our results, handgrip strength and relative handgrip strength were associated with T2DM. People with hypertension had a higher risk of T2DM in women with a handgrip strength of ≤ 17.350kg and a relative grip strength of ≤ 0.240. Further research is needed to validate the effectiveness of this cut-off for implementing interventions and avoiding risks.","",""

The patients were divided into 2 groups based on the pre- or postmenopausal occurrence of EC. The general clinical characteristics, intraoperative situation, clinicopathological data, and postoperative outcomes of the 2 groups were compared. Patients with premenopausal EC had earlier menarche, a higher incidence of primary infertility and anemia, and fewer pregnancies and deliveries. Patients with postmenopausal EC were older and often had hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Additionally, patients who were postmenopausal had worse tumor pathological gradings, more severe muscular invasion, and a higher rate of lymphatic metastasis. These factors led to a higher demand for postoperative radiotherapy in patients but a lower survival rate. Generally, premenopausal EC differs from postmenopausal EC: the latter is more malignant and has a worse prognosis.","",""

Furthermore, we have evaluated the role of age and gender in the relationship between the PON1 activity and IL-6. A total of 105 people with T2D were enrolled in this study. IL-6 levels were determined using ELISA. For the PON1 activity assay, the hydrolysis rate of the substrate phenylacetate was spectrophotometrically assayed in serum at 270 nm. The determined velocities were the initial velocities of substrate hydrolysis. PON1 activity was negatively correlated with IL-6 in total data (r = -0.34, P = 0.001). In both groups with age ≥50 and <50 years, PON1 activity was negatively correlated with IL-6, but the correlation was significant in patients aged 50 years and above (r = -0.358, P = 0.005) compared with patients with age <50 years. In both women and men, PON1 activity was negatively correlated with IL-6, but the correlation was significant in women (r = -0.318, P = 0.006) in comparison with men. Inverse association between PON1 activity and IL-6 in T2D may represent the oxidative-inflammatory interaction in this disease. Our findings highlight that at older ages and in women, the associations between lower PON1 activity and higher IL-6 concentrations are more evident, and this should be considered in patients with T2D.","",""

To evaluate glucose testing among those undiagnosed, we excluded those self-reporting a previous diagnosis of diabetes. We then defined recent access to diabetes diagnosis by considering the previous two years and choosing the last blood glucose test and the proximal medical consultation reported. We used Poisson regression with robust variance to assess correlates of access, expressing them with adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95% confidence intervals. Access to recent glucose testing documented that over 70% reported a recent glycemic test, 71% in 2013, and 77% in 2019. These findings are consistent with a wide recent access to medical consultation, 86% and 89% in 2013 and 2019, respectively.

Total leukocyte count and subtypes levels were grouped by quintile. After adjusting for age, sex, family history of diabetes, lifestyle score, and triglyceride levels, all were compared with the lowest quintile of each group. Logistic regression model results showed that the corrected OR for those with the highest quintile level of leukocyte was 2.01 (95% CI: 1.02-3.98).

A logistic regression was conducted to develop a TBA-based diagnostic model for differentiating abnormal bone metabolism from those with normal BMD. We evaluated the performance of model using ROC curves. The TBA level was significantly higher in patients with osteoporosis (Median[M]= 3.300 μmol/L, interquartile range [IQR] = 1.725 to 5.250 μmol/L) compared to the osteopenia group (M = 3.200 μmol/L, IQR = 2.100 to 5.400 μmol/L) and control group (M = 2.750 μmol/L, IQR = 1.800 to 4.600 μmol/L) (P <0.05). Overall and subgroup analyses indicated that TBA was negatively associated with BMD after adjusted for the co-variates (i.e., age, gender, diabetes duration, BMI, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin) (P <0.05). Logistic regression revealed that higher TBA level was associated with increased risk for abnormal bone metabolism (OR = 1.044, 95% CI = 1.005 to 1.083). A TBA-based diagnostic model was established to identify individuals with abnormal bone metabolism (T-score ≤ -1.0). The area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.767 (95% CI = 0.730 to 0.804). Our findings demonstrated the potential role of bile acids in bone metabolism among T2DM patients. The circulating TBA might be employed as an indicator of abnormal bone metabolism.","",""

We conducted a literature search in July 2022 using the PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases, and finally, 32 studies (N = 3812) were included. We did a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of placenta-related disorders, including placenta previa, placental abruption, placenta accreta, placenta increta, and retained placenta. We also included other obstetric and neonatal outcomes like postpartum hemorrhage, ectopic pregnancy, oligohydramnios, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, and intrauterine growth restriction. The results were presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in studies with a control group, but otherwise as prevalence (%) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The overall pregnancy and live birth rates were 58.97% and 45.56%, respectively. The prevalence of placenta previa differed in pregnant women who underwent hysteroscopic adhesiolysis compared with those who did not (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.28-8.36). In studies without a comparative group, the pooled rate of placenta accreta was 7% (95% CI, 4-11) in 20 studies; placenta increta was 1% (95% CI, 0-4) in 5 studies; a retained placenta was 11% (95% CI, 5-24) in 5 studies; postpartum hemorrhage was 12% (95% CI, 8-18) in 12 studies; ectopic pregnancy was 1% (95% CI, 0-2) in 13 studies; oligohydramnios was 3% (95% CI, 1-6) in 3 studies; intrauterine growth restriction was 3% (95% CI, 1-8) in 3 studies; gestational hypertension was 5% (95% CI, 2-11) in 4 studies; and diabetes mellitus was 4% (95% CI, 2-7) in 3 studies.

The main objective of this study was to observe the dynamic changes of serum taurine during pregnancy and investigate the relationship between serum taurine levels and GDM in the first and second trimesters. This was a nested case-control study in 47 women with GDM and 47 age-matched normoglycemic women. We examined serum taurine at 8-12 weeks' gestation and 24-28 weeks' gestation. The serum taurine of the two groups was compared. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate how serum taurine was associated with GDM. The serum taurine concentration of GDM women was significantly lower than that of normoglycemic women in the first trimester(2.29 vs 3.94 μmol/L, P<0.001). As the pregnancy progressed, serum taurine concentration in normoglycaemic women decreased significantly(3.94 vs 2.47 μmol/L, P<0.001), but not in the GDM group(2.29 vs 2.37 μmol/L, P=0.249), resulting in the disappearance of differences between the two groups(2.47 vs 2.37 μmol/L, P=0.160). After adjustment for pre-pregnancy body mass index(BMI), fasting plasma glucose(FPG), and lipid profiles in the first trimester, the serum taurine concentration in the first trimester was negatively correlated with the risk of GDM(OR=0.017, 95% CI=0.003-0.107, P<0.001). Furthermore, dynamic change of serum taurine showed a significantly positive correlation with the risk of GDM(OR=9.909, 95% CI=3.556-27.610, P<0.001). Low serum taurine concentration in the first trimester was significantly associated with the development of GDM. As the pregnancy progressed, the association between serum taurine and GDM disappeared in the second trimester, which might be related to the inhibition of taurine transporter(TauT) activity by high glucose.","",""

In order to identify the shared genetic architecture of the two disease phenotypes of NAFLD and T2D, a European population-based GWAS summary and a cross-trait meta-analysis was used to identify significant shared genes for NAFLD and T2D. The enrichment of shared genes was then determined through the use of functional enrichment analysis to investigate the relationship between genes and phenotypes. Additionally, differential gene expression analysis was performed, significant differentially expressed genes in NAFLD and T2D were identified, genes that overlapped between those that were differentially expressed and cross-trait results were reported, and enrichment analysis was performed on the core genes that had been obtained in this way. Finally, the application of a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach determined the causal link between NAFLD and T2D. A total of 115 genes were discovered to be shared between NAFLD and T2D in the GWAS analysis. The enrichment analysis of these genes showed that some were involved in the processes such as the decomposition and metabolism of lipids, phospholipids, and glycerophospholipids. Additionally, through the use of differential gene expression analysis, 15 core genes were confirmed to be linked to both T2D and NAFLD. They were correlated with carcinoma cells and inflammation. Furthermore, the bidirectional MR identified a positive causal relationship between NAFLD and T2D. Our study determined the genetic structure shared between NAFLD and T2D, offering a new reference for the genetic pathogenesis and mechanism of NAFLD and T2D comorbidities.","",""

We conducted a cross-sectional real-world observational study of 411 patients with T2DM. The levels of fasting C-peptide, 2h postprandial C-peptide, the ratio of fasting C-peptide to 2h postprandial C-peptide (C0/C2 ratio), UA and other characteristics were recorded.

T2DM is associated with long-term complications that have contributed to the burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The objective of this manuscript is to conduct an Exome-Wide Association Study (EWAS) on T2DM Emirati individuals to improve our understanding on diabetes-related complications to improve early diagnostic methods and treatment strategies. This cross-sectional study recruited 310 Emirati participants that were stratified according to their medically diagnosed diabetes-related complications: diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and cardiovascular complications. The Illumina's Infinium Exome-24 array was used and 39,840 SNPs remained for analysis after quality control. The analysis revealed the associations of various genes with each complication category: 1) diabetic retinopathy was associated to SHANK3 gene in locus 22q13.33 (SNP rs9616915; p=5.18 x10-4), ZSCAN5A gene in locus 19q13.43 (SNP rs7252603; p=7.55 x10-4), and DCP1B gene in locus 12p13.33 (SNPs rs715146, rs1044950, rs113147414, rs34730825; p=7.62 x10-4); 2) diabetic neuropathy was associated to ADH4 gene in locus 4q23 (SNP rs4148883; p=1.23 x10-4), SLC11A1 gene in locus 2q35 (SNP rs17235409; p=1.85 x10-4), and MATN4 gene in locus 20q13.12 (SNP rs2072788; p=2.68 x10-4); 3) diabetic nephropathy was associated to PPP1R3A gene in locus 7q31.1 (SNP rs1799999; p=1.91 x10-4), ZNF136 gene in locus 19p13.2 (SNP rs140861589; p=2.80 x10-4), and HSPA12B gene in locus 20p13 (SNP rs6076550; p=2.86 x10-4); and 4) cardiovascular complications was associated to PCNT gene in locus 21q22.3 (SNPs rs7279204, rs6518289, rs2839227, rs2839223; p=2.18 x10-4,3.04 x10-4,4.51 x10-4,5.22 x10-4 respectively), SEPT14 gene in locus 7p11.2 (SNP rs146350220; p=2.77 x10-4), and WDR73 gene in locus 15q25.2 (SNP rs72750868; p=4.47 x10-4). We have identified susceptibility loci associated with each category of T2DM-related complications in the Emirati population. Given that only 16% of the markers from the Illumina's Infinium Exome chip passed quality control assessment, this demonstrates that multiple variants were, either, monomorphic in the Arab population or were not genotyped due to the use of a Euro-centric EWAS array that limits the possibility of including targeted ethnic-specific SNPs. Our results suggest the alarming possibility that lack of representation in reference panels could inhibit discovery of functionally important loci associated to T2DM complications. Further effort must be conducted to improve the representation of diverse populations in genotyping and sequencing studies.","",""

Obstetric characteristics and the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes were examined in stressed and non-stressed women. The associations between maternal prenatal stress with adverse pregnancy outcomes were analyzed by logistic regression. The incidence of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) was significantly higher in stressed pregnant women than non-stressed pregnant women (p = 0.035), whereas no significant difference in the incidence rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), primary cesarean delivery, preterm birth, macrosomia, low birth weight, fetal stress, admission into neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or neonatal jaundice was found between two groups. Maternal second-trimester stress was an independent risk factor for the development of PROM (aOR = 1.468, 95% CI 1.037-2.079). Moreover, maternal second-trimester stress was significantly associated with PROM in pregnant women with normal pre-pregnancy BMI (aOR = 1.587, 95% CI 1.068-2.357) while no association was observed in either underweight or overweight and obese pregnant women. Meanwhile, no difference was found in the odds of PROM with maternal second-trimester stress in all GWG subgroups. Maternal second-trimester stress is associated with a higher risk of PROM and it is significant in pregnant women with normal pre-pregnancy BMI. Therefore, interventions to reduce stress during second-trimester of pregnancy might be essential for lowering the prevalence of PROM in pregnant women with normal pre-pregnancy BMI.","",""

In addition to increasing mortality, it also lengthens the hospital stay and raises healthcare expenses. SSIs are challenging to predict, with most models having poor predictability. Therefore, we developed a prediction model for SSI after elective abdominal surgery by identifying risk factors. To analyse the data on inpatients undergoing elective abdominal surgery to identify risk factors and develop predictive models that will help clinicians assess patients preoperatively. We retrospectively analysed the inpatient records of Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital from January 1, 2018 to January 1, 2021. We included the demographic data of the patients and their haematological test results in our analysis. The attending physicians provided the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) scores. The surgeons and anaesthesiologists manually calculated the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) scores. Inpatient SSI risk factors were evaluated using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Nomograms were used in the predictive models. The receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve values were used to measure the specificity and accuracy of the model. A total of 3018 patients met the inclusion criteria. The surgical sites included the uterus (42.2%), the liver (27.6%), the gastrointestinal tract (19.1%), the appendix (5.9%), the kidney (3.7%), and the groin area (1.4%). SSI occurred in 5% of the patients (n = 150). The risk factors associated with SSI were as follows: Age; gender; marital status; place of residence; history of diabetes; surgical season; surgical site; NRS 2002 score; preoperative white blood cell, procalcitonin (PCT), albumin, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels; preoperative antibiotic use; anaesthesia method; incision grade; NNIS score; intraoperative blood loss; intraoperative drainage tube placement; surgical operation items. Multivariate logistic regression revealed the following independent risk factors: A history of diabetes [odds ratio (OR) = 5.698, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.305-9.825, P = 0.001], antibiotic use (OR = 14.977, 95%CI: 2.865-78.299, P = 0.001), an NRS 2002 score of ≥ 3 (OR = 2.426, 95%CI: 1.199-4.909, P = 0.014), general anaesthesia (OR = 3.334, 95%CI: 1.134-9.806, P = 0.029), an NNIS score of ≥ 2 (OR = 2.362, 95%CI: 1.019-5.476, P = 0.045), PCT ≥ 0.05 μg/L (OR = 1.687, 95%CI: 1.056-2.695, P = 0.029), LDL < 3.37 mmol/L (OR = 1.719, 95%CI: 1.039-2.842, P = 0.035), intraoperative blood loss ≥ 200 mL (OR = 29.026, 95%CI: 13.751-61.266, P < 0.001), surgical season (P < 0.05), surgical site (P < 0.05), and incision grade I or III (P < 0.05).

The patient's condition and haematological test indicators form the bases of our prediction model. It is a novel, efficient, and highly accurate predictive model for preventing postoperative SSI, thereby improving the prognosis in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.","",""

Uncontrolled diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia which over time leads to fatal damage to both macro-and microvascular systems, causing complications such as cardiovascular diseases, retinopathy and nephropathy. Diabetes management is conventionally delivered through modifications of diet and lifestyle and pharmacological treatment, using antidiabetic drugs, and ultimately insulin injections. However, the side effects and financial cost of medications often reduce patient compliance to treatment, negatively affecting their health outcomes. Natural phytochemicals from edible plants such as fruits and vegetables (F&V) and medicinal herbs have drawn a growing interest as potential therapeutic agents for treating diabetes and preventing the onset and progression of diabetic complications. Flavonoids, the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet, have shown antidiabetic effects in numerous in vitro and preclinical studies. The underlying mechanisms have been linked to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Carotenoids, another major group of dietary phytochemicals, have also shown antidiabetic potential in recent in vitro and in vivo experimental models, possibly through a mechanism of action similar to that of flavonoids. However, scientific evidence on the efficacy of these phytochemicals in treating diabetes or preventing the onset and progression of its complications in clinical settings is scarce, which delays the translation of animal study evidence to human applications and also limits the knowledge on their modes of actions in diabetes management. This review is aimed to highlight the potential roles of flavonoids and carotenoids in preventing or ameliorating diabetes-related complications based on in vivo study evidence, i.e., an array of preclinical animal studies and human intervention trials. The current general consensus of the underlying mechanisms of action exerted by both groups of phytochemicals is that their anti-inflammatory action is key. However, other potential mechanisms of action are considered. In total, 50 in vivo studies were selected for a review after a comprehensive database search via PubMed and ScienceDirect from January 2002 to August 2022.

We used factor analysis to identify dietary patterns. Factors associated with dietary patterns were analyzed using multiple linear regression models. The adjusted regression coefficients with their 95% CI were used to ascertain the association. We identified three major dietary patterns that explained 51% of the variance in food consumption. The western dietary pattern was characterized by the consumption of meat/organ meat, biscuits/sweets, chicken stew, pasta-macaroni recipes, butter, white wheat bread, egg recipe, and Ethiopian dish shiro-wet, and was positively associated with urban residence, obesity, hypertension, blood glucose, and total cholesterol levels. Adherence to the consumption of tubers, whole-grain maize products, coffee leaves-and-herbs beverage, legumes, and sweet potatoes featured the traditional dietary pattern. The traditional dietary pattern showed a positive relationship with rural residence, physical activity, and obesity, and it had a negative relationship with hypertension. The healthy dietary pattern was characterized by the intake of green leafy vegetables, green pepper, and whole-grain maize products, and negatively related to obesity, and hypertension, while positively related to urban residence. The coexistence of western, traditional, and healthy dietary patterns in the present study indicates the transition to a new dietary pattern in the study area. All dietary patterns were associated with one or more cardiovascular risk factors, but the western dietary pattern was associated with most of these, while the traditional diet showed fewer such associations. Therefore, it might be useful to promote healthy and traditional dietary patterns along with physical activity. Interventions related to the current findings, if initiated early in life, may benefit the public in preventing cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, and type 2-diabetes.","",""

This review outlines what is known about the genetic and epigenetic contributors to obesity susceptibility, along with the albeit limited therapeutic options currently available. Furthermore, we delineate the potential mechanisms of actions through which epigenetic changes can mediate environmental influences and the related opportunities they present for future interventions in the management of obesity.","",""

To our knowledge there is only one other reported case of pneumorrhachis in the setting of emphysematous cystitis. This is a single case report of pneumorrhachis in the setting of emphysematous cystitis. An 82-year-old Asian female patient originally from East Asia, with no prior medical history besides hypertension, presented to hospital with a chief complaint of acute on chronic neck pain and functional decline. Examination revealed nonspecific neurosensory deficits and suprapubic tenderness. Laboratory investigations demonstrated leukocytosis and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase containing Escherichia coli bacteremia and bacteriuria. Computed tomography showed emphysematous cystitis with widespread gas within the cervical and lumbar spinal canal, as well as multiple gas-containing soft tissue collections in the bilateral psoas muscles and paraspinal soft tissues. Despite prompt antimicrobial therapy the patient passed away within 48 hours from septic shock. Our case adds to a growing body of literature showing that the spread of air to distant sites, including the spine, may be a poor prognostic indicator in patients with gangrenous intraabdominal infections. This report highlights the importance of recognizing the causes and presentation of pneumorrhachis to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of potentially life threatening and treatable causes.","",""

PUFA peroxidation compounds were determined in urine samples from obese human subjects (n = 46) by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Increased omega-6 arachidonic acid (AA) oxidation, mainly represented by 5-F2c isoprostane (5-F2c-IsoP) and metabolites of 15-F2t-IsoP, was associated with body mass index, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and mean arterial blood pressure.

The omega-3 to omega-6 oxidation ratio was a significant predictor of inflammation in obesity. The findings point to full urinary isoprostanoid profiling as a more sensitive measure of PUFA oxidative stress in obesity-induced metabolic complications compared with individual isoprostanoid measures.

In this study, we assessed the prevalence of pDDIs between medications for chronic conditions metabolized through the CYP3A4 metabolic pathway and ritonavir-containing COVID-19 medications in the US general population. This study combined National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) waves 2015 to 2016 and 2017 to March 2020 to observe pDDI prevalence between ritonavir-containing therapy and coadministered medications among US adults 18 years or older. CYP3A4-mediated medications were identified from affirmative medication questionnaire response and associated prescription examination by surveyors. CYP3A4-mediated medications with associated pDDIs with ritonavir and assessed pDDI severity (minor, major, moderate, and severe) were obtained from the University of Liverpool's COVID-19 online drug interaction checker, Lexicomp, and US Food and Drug Administration fact sheets. pDDI prevalence and severity were evaluated by demographic characteristics and COVID-19 risk factors. A total of 15,685 adult participants were identified during the 2015 to 2020 NHANES waves. Survey participants used a mean (SD) of 2.7 (1.8) drugs with likelihood of a pDDI. The weighted prevalence of major to contraindicated pDDIs among the US population was 29.3%. Prevalence rates among those 60 years and older, with serious heart conditions, with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD), with severe CKD, with diabetes, and with HIV were 60.2%, 80.7%, 73.9%, 69.5%, 63.4%, and 68.5%, respectively. Results remained largely unchanged after removal of statins from the list of drugs associated with ritonavir-based pDDIs. Approximately one-third of the US population would be at risk for a major or contraindicated pDDI should they receive a ritonavir-containing regimen, and this risk increases significantly among individuals 60 years or older and with comorbidities such as serious heart conditions, CKD, diabetes, and HIV. The state of polypharmacy in the US population and the quickly changing COVID-19 landscape indicate significant risk of pDDIs among those requiring treatment with ritonavir-containing COVID-19 medications. Practitioners should take polypharmacy, age, and comorbidity profile into account when prescribing COVID-19 therapies. Alternative treatment regimens should be considered, especially for those of older age and those with risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19.","",""

This study was conducted to assess the association between early fetal heart tracing (FHT) and maternal tocodynamometry patterns and the incidence of adverse fetal and pregnancy outcomes after the administration of oral misoprostol for cervical ripening. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 9908 low-risk patients at ≥37 weeks gestation who received oral misoprostol for cervical ripening prior to rupture of membranes between 01/01/2012 and 12/31/2017 at Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals as inpatients. We excluded patients who received a different agent for cervical ripening or had any need for additional inpatient monitoring, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, diabetes, or intrauterine growth restriction. Abnormal FHT, abnormal uterine activity, and adverse pregnancy or fetal-related events documented in the electronic health record in the four hours after administration of the first and second doses of misoprostol were assessed using descriptive statistics. We found that 0.9% of patients experienced tachysystole after the first dose of misoprostol (0.6% without decelerations; 0.3% with decelerations). The incidence of variable decelerations only and other FHT abnormalities (i.e. bradycardia, late or prolonged decelerations, or absent or minimal variability) in the first hour after misoprostol administration were 7.1% and 6.7% respectively, and diminished over time. The need for tocolytic use was 0.2% in the first hour and declined over time to 0.03% in the fourth hour after the first dose. Urgent cesarean delivery occurred in 0.1% of patients after receiving the first dose of misoprostol. Patients who did not experience variable, prolonged, or late decelerations in the first hour after the initial misoprostol dose were less likely to have such FHT abnormalities in the subsequent three hours compared to patients who had other FHT abnormalities (11.8% among patients with no FHT abnormalities vs. 43.7% among patients with other FHT abnormalities; p <.001). The overall trends in outcomes over time were similar after the second dose of misoprostol. The risk of short-term adverse outcomes associated with misoprostol is low among relatively low-risk patients. FHT abnormalities occurred in up to 32% of patients in the first four hours of monitoring post-misoprostol. Patients with no FHT abnormalities in the first hour after receiving misoprostol had a low risk of developing adverse outcomes and FHT abnormalities on continued monitoring, while patients with any type of deceleration in the first hour were at higher risk of adverse outcomes and FHT abnormalities. Our data may inform the development of protocols for cervical ripening that allow reduced monitoring for a subset of low-risk patients, however, more research is needed to validate findings and develop clinical protocols.","",""

Variations in its structure across vertebrates are primarily due to the nature of alterations in number, complexity, arrangement, and location of the kidney tubules. Globally, individuals aged 65 and older are part of the fastest expanding population demographic, and as a result, a greater number of older patients are receiving a diagnosis of impaired renal function. The purpose of our mini-review is to summarize recent findings of the structural and functional differences between the normal and aging kidney, examine the evolutionary biology of the kidney across species, and demonstrate the role of aging in conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension, along with their impact on SARS-CoV-2. Additional aims include discussing the potential therapeutic strategies to treat aged individuals with kidney health issues and how the impact of a healthy lifestyle, diet, and exercise can improve health conditions with aged kidneys.","",""

Fibrotic NASH was defined as the presence of NASH on liver biopsy with NAFLD Activity Score ≥4 and fibrosis stage F≥2 according to the NASH CRN scoring system. AUROC of MACK-3 for fibrotic NASH was 0.791 [0.768-0.814]. Sensitivity at the previously published MACK-3 threshold of <0.135 was 91% and specificity at its >0.549 threshold was 85%. The MACK-3 AUROC was not affected by age, sex, diabetes, or BMI. MACK-3 and FAST results were well correlated (Rs=0.781, P < .001).

To date, pyroptosis-associated inflammasome pathways have been identified primarily in the canonical and non-canonical inflammasome pathway, apoptotic caspase-mediated pathway, granzyme-mediated pathway, and streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB)-mediated pathway. The activation of diabetes-mediated pyroptosis-associated factors play an important role in the pathophysiology of DM and its complications. Studies have shown that ginsenosides exert significant protective effects on DM and its complications. Through inhibiting the activation of pyroptosis-associated inflammasome pathways, and then the DM and its complications are improved. This review summarizes the subtypes of ginsenosides and their chemical characteristics, pharmacokinetics and side effects, the main pyroptosis-associated inflammasome pathways that have been discovered to date, and the potential mechanism of different subtypes of ginsenosides in the treatment of DM and its complications (such as diabetic cardiomyopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic liver injury, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic ischemic stroke) via anti-pyroptosis-associated inflammasome pathways. These findings may provide ideas for further research to explore ginsenoside mechanism in improving DM and its complications. However, many pyroptosis-associated inflammasome pathways and targets involved in the occurrence and development of DM and its complications are still unknown. In the future, further studies using in vitro cell models, in vivo animal models, and human disease models can be used to further elucidate the mechanism of ginsenosides in the treatment of DM and its complications.","",""

Serum metabolomic profiles of these patients were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), and serum Sema3A levels measured by ELISA. Metabolomics analysis revealed a set of metabolites that were altered in the serum of PDR patients as compared with NPDR and NDR groups. Among these metabolites total asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and Kynurenine were potential predictors of PDR patients. Significantly higher serum levels of Sema3A in PDR patients as compared with NPDR and NDR groups (p < 0.001), their serum levels were positively correlated with the central macular thickness (r= 0.952, p < 0.001) and negatively correlated with the superficial macular density (r=-0.952, p < 0.001).

The diagnosis was confirmed in 254 patients after reviewing by ophthalmology, and the screening program achieved a positive predictive value for DR of 77.7%. Seventy-three were excluded by ophthalmology due to the absence of DR (false positive rate - 22.3%). In 92.5% of the cases classified by the ophthalmologist, the degree of DR was mild or very mild. Our telemedicine screening program for DR in patients with type 1 DM is consistent with the literature. Effective screening for DR is performed, with patients diagnosed in the early stages. Telemedicine programs facilitate efficient communication among healthcare personnel.","",""

Obesity is also involved in the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Recently, an increase in the incidence of obesity-related cancers has been reported. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy, after lymphoma. The aim of this review is to examine the epidemiological data on obesity and MM, assess the effect of obesity on MM outcomes, evaluate the possible mechanisms through which obesity might increase the incidence of MM and provide the effects of obesity management on MM. Current evidence indicates that obesity may have an impact on the progression of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to MM and increase the prevalence of MM. However, data regarding the effect of obesity on MGUS incidence are controversial; further studies are needed to examine whether obesity affects the development of MGUS or the progression of MGUS to MM. In addition, obesity affects MM outcomes. Increased BMI is associated with decreased survival in patients with MM, while data regarding the effect of obesity on newly diagnosed MM subjects and autologous stem cell transplantation are limited. Interestingly, the obesity paradox may also apply to patients with relapsed/refractory MM who are overweight or obese, because they may have a survival advantage. The pathophysiological pathways linking obesity to MM are very complicated and include bone marrow adipose tissue; adipokines, such as adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and visfatin; inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, such as TNF-α and IL-6; hormones including insulin and the insulin-like growth factor system as well as sex hormones. In terms of the effect of pharmacological management of obesity, orlistat has been shown to alter the proliferation of MM cells, whereas no data exist on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, naltrexone/bupropion, or phentermine/topiramate. Bariatric surgery may be associated with a reduction in the incidence of MM, however, further studies are needed.","",""

It was the main target of our team since 2002 to explore the etiology of IBD and the related role of bacteria. For almost two decades, our laboratory, among others, has been involved in the reciprocal interaction between the host gastrointestinal lining and the homing microbiota. In the first decade, the attention of scientists focused on the possible role of enteropathogenic E. coli and its relationship to the mechanistic pathways involved in IBD induced in both rats and mice by chemicals like Iodoacetamide, Dextran Sodium Sulfate, Trinitrobenzene, thus linking microbial alteration to IBD pathology. A thorough characterization of the various models was the focus of research in addition to exploring how to establish an active homeostatic composition of the commensal microbiota, including its wide diversity by restoration of gut microbiota by probiotics and moving from dysbiosis to eubiosis. In the last six years and in order to effectively translate such findings into clinical practice, it was critical to explore their relationship to colorectal cancer CRC both in solid tumors and chemically induced CRC. It was also critical to explore the degree of intestinal dysbiosis and linking to IBD, CRC and diabetes. Remarkably, the active mechanistic pathways were proposed as well as the role of microbiota or bacterial metabolites involved. This review covers two decades of investigations in our laboratory and sheds light on the different aspects of the relationship between microbiota and IBD with an emphasis on dysbiosis, probiotics and the multiple mechanistic pathways involved.","",""

The amylin-Aβ ELISA relies on a monoclonal anti-Aβ middomain antibody (detection) and a polyclonal anti-amylin antibody (capture) designed to recognize an epitope that is distinct from the high affinity amylin-Aβ binding sites. The utility of this assay is supported by analysis of molecular amylin-Aβ co-deposition in post-mortem brain tissue obtained from persons with and without AD pathology.

Here, the effects of the laser power, pulse repetition frequency, and ablation duration on the Surface Plasmon Resonance peak of AgNPs solutions, were used to determine the optimal parameters. Also, the effects of the laser ablation time on both ablation efficiency and SERS enhancement were studied. The synthesized AgNPs were characterized by UV-Vis spectrophotometer, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Raman spectrometer. The Surface Plasmon Resonance peak of AgNP solutions was centered at 404 nm confirming their synthesis and they were noted to be spherical with 34 nm in diameter. Using Raman spectroscopy, they had main bands centered at 196 cm-1 (O = Ag2/Ag-N stretching vibrations), 568 cm-1 (NH out of plane bending); 824 cm-1 (symmetric deformation of the NO2); 1060 cm-1 (NH out of plane bending); 1312 cm-1 (symmetric stretching of NO2); 1538 cm-1 (NH in-plane bending); and 2350 cm-1 (N2 vibrations). Their Raman spectral profiles remained constant within the first few days of storage at room temperature implying chemical stability. The Raman signals from blood were enhanced when mixed with AgNPs and this depended on colloidal AgNPs concentration. Using those generated by 12 h ablation time, an enhancement of 14.95 was achieved. Additionally, these substrates had an insignificant impact on the Raman profiles of samples of rat blood when mixed with them. The Raman peaks noted were attributed to CC stretching of glucose (932 cm-1); CC stretching of Tryptophan (1064 cm-1); CC stretching of β Carotene (1190 cm-1); CH2 wagging of proteins (1338 and 1410 cm-1); carbonyl stretch for proteins (1650 cm-1); CN vibrations for glycoproteins (2122 cm-1). These SERS substrates can be applied to areas such as forensics to distinguish between human and other animal blood, monitoring of the efficacy of drugs, disease diagnostics such as diabetes, and pathogen detection. All this can be achieved by comparing the Raman spectra of the biological samples mixed with the synthesized SERS substrates for different samples. Thus, the results on the use of inexpensive, simple-to-prepare Raman substrates have the possibility of making surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy available to laboratories with scarce resources in developing nations.","",""

The patients who had had DFUs of at least four weeks' duration and who had been treated in the wound clinic between January 2014 and 2017 were included in the study. The patients were divided into study and control groups. The study group consisted of patients in whom intralesional recombinant human EGF, Heberprot-p 75μg, was applied; the control group consisted of the remaining patients in whom EGF was not applied. The efficacy of Heberprot-p treatment in Wagner 2 and 3 DFUs were retrospectively investigated. The study group (n=29 patients) who received Heberprot-p treatment was found to have shorter treatment times and higher rates of wound healing than the control group (n=22 patients). Although the amputation rate in the study group was less than the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. Heberprot-p therapy is a promising treatment in DFUs, which can be routinely used as an adjunct to standard care.","",""

The Short-Form Six-Dimension (SF-6D) is a frequently BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are typically stigmatized conditions associated with negative stereotypes, which may lead individuals to underreport them. Thus, survey data may be subject to biases. Although administrative data has some limitations, it is an alternative data source that may be considered more objective. This study aimed to identify the degree of agreement between survey and administrative health care data for mental health conditions, factors affecting underreporting, and whether underreporting also occurs for physical health conditions. We used Ontario data from the Canadian Community Health Survey linked to health records to examine the presence of mental health conditions (i.e., schizophrenia and mood disorders) and select physical health conditions (i.e., diabetes and cancer). Using administrative data as the reference standard, we created four categories for each health condition based on the level of agreement between the two data sources: consistent cases and non-cases (i.e. individuals with concordant data based on their reported health condition), and people who were found to underreport and overreport a condition (i.e. where the condition was present in the administrative data, but not in the survey data and vice-versa, respectively). The overall level of agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa statistic. Probit regressions were estimated to determine the factors affecting underreporting. The Kappa statistics for mood disorder was fair (k= 0.26) and moderate for schizophrenia (k = 0.49). Physical health conditions had higher kappa values (diabetes, k = 0.81; ever having cancer, k = 0.68), with the exception of currently having cancer (k = 0.24). Underreporting was highest for the most stigmatizing condition, schizophrenia (63%), followed by mood disorders (39%) and cancer (39%), and lowest for diabetes (25%). Older age, being born in Africa and Asia, and being employed all increased the probability of underreporting among individuals identified in the administrative data; the opposite held for social assistance. We extended previous work on mental health reporting by combining survey data with administrative data to examine the level of agreement between respondents' self-reported mental health and administrative records. The data include some mental disorders not studied previously. We examined the entire adult population; this is important because prevalence of schizophrenia may be less common among older population groups due to higher mortality among this patient population. Additionally, there may be potential age-related differences in stigma and mental health conditions. The administrative health data captured only health services covered by the public provincial health insurance plan and thus did not capture medical care provided by psychologists, social workers, and nurses. While this would affect Kappa statistic values, it does not directly affect the underreporting analyses. Our results suggest that disclosure of mental health conditions may differ by the level of stigma, which has implications for obtaining accurate estimates of mental health prevalence from self-reported data sources. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH: It may be useful to use a combination of both survey and administrative data when estimating the prevalence of mental disorders. Future research should seek to examine overreporting and its determinants.","",""

Therefore, the aim of this scoping review was to explore the available evidence on the relationship between chronic kidney disease and severe mental illness. Electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched. The database searches were limited to articles published between January 2000-January 2022, due to significant progress that has been made in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of both SMI and CKD. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they explored the relationship between SMI and CKD (Stages 1-5) in terms of prevalence, risk factors, clinical outcomes, and access to treatment and services. Severe mental illness was defined as conditions that can present with psychosis, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and other psychotic disorders. Thirty articles were included in the review. The included studies illustrated that there is an increased risk of chronic kidney disease amongst people who have severe mental illness, compared to those who do not. However, people who have severe mental illness and chronic kidney disease are less likely to receive specialist nephrology care, are less likely to be evaluated for a transplant, and have higher rates of mortality. In conclusion, there is a dearth of literature in this area, but the available literature suggests there are significant health inequalities in kidney care amongst people who have severe mental illness. Further research is needed to understand the factors that contribute to this relationship, and to develop strategies to improve both clinical outcomes and access to kidney care.","",""

It has been established that the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways play an important role in regulating inflammation and oxidative stress. Several potential treatment strategies involving Nrf2 and/or NF-κB pathways have been explored in previous studies.

Haemoglobin A1c levels were measured after questionnaire completion. A total of 106 patients completed the questionnaire with a mean age of 13.91 (± SD 2.48) years. Mean haemoglobin A1c and SDSCA score were 9.78 (± SD 2.43)% and 19.09 (± SD 5.81), respectively. Type 1 DM patients had significantly higher haemoglobin A1c (10.11 95% CI [9.62, 10.59] vs 8.38 95% CI [7.13, 9.62]). Total score was higher in type 1 DM although not statistically significant (19.32 95% CI [18.21, 20.43] vs 18.08 95% CI [14.28, 21.87]). Blood glucose testing score was significantly higher in type 1 DM (5.24 95% CI [4.82, 5.66] vs 3.50 95% CI [2.23, 4.77]). There was statistically significant negative correlation between score in diet subcategory and haemoglobin A1c. In conclusion, self-care activities among diabetic children and adolescents are still suboptimal. Self-care activities on blood glucose testing are significantly better in type 1 DM. Diet section correlated well with glycaemic control necessitating further research.","",""

We employed single-nerve-fiber recordings in type 2 diabetes patients with (spDN) and without cutaneous pain (DN) and in streptozotocin-diabetic and healthy mice. In mice, we measured Ca++ transients in cultured DRG neurons and stimulated CGRP release from hairy skin. In diabetic patients we recorded a large proportion of pathologically altered nerve C-fibers (79%). In spDN patients we found a higher percentage (72%) of spontaneously active C- nociceptors than in DN patients (15%). The proportion of spontaneous activity was highest among pathological fibers with mechanoinsensitive fiber properties which are particularly sensitive to MGO in contrast to mechanosensitive fibers. Mouse polymodal nociceptors, in contrast to purely mechanosensitive C-fibers, showed highest prevalence of TRPA1-related chemosensitivity. In diabetic mice about 37% of polymodal nociceptors developed spontaneous activity and exhibited significantly greater MGO responses, indicating sensitized TRPA1 receptors. Low-threshold mechanosensitive Aδ-fibers were vigorously activated by MGO but independently of TRPA1 activation. Our translational findings suggest that TRPA1-expressing C-nociceptors, which in human correspond to mechanoinsensitive and in mice to polymodal nociceptors, are especially vulnerable to develop spontaneous activity. Those two different nociceptor classes might share the functional role as dicarbonyl-sensitive chemosensors and represent the critical nociceptor population that support the development of pain and hyperalgesia in diabetic neuropathy.","",""

This cross-sectional study was executed in the northern state of Punjab, India. It involves the multi-stage area sampling technique and data was collected through a self-structured questionnaire adapted following the ""WHO STEPS Surveillance"" manual. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to compare the cost differences in socio-demographic variables. Lastly, multiple linear regression was conducted to determine and evaluate the association of the dependent variable with numerous influential determinants. The urban respondents' average direct and indirect costs are higher than rural respondents. Age manifests very eccentric results; the highest mean direct outpatient care expenditure of ₹52,104 was incurred by the respondents below 20 years of age. Gender, complications, income, history of diabetes and work status were statistically significant determinants of the total cost. Study reports a rapid increase in the median annual direct and indirect cost from ₹15,460 and ₹3572 in 1999 to ₹34,100 and ₹4200 in 2021. The present study highlights that the economic jeopardy of diabetes can be managed by educating people about diabetes and its associated risk factors. The economic burden of diabetes could be restrained by formulating new health policies and promoting the use of generic medicines. The result of the study directs that expenditure on outpatient care is to be reimbursed under the 'Ayushman Bharat-Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana'.","",""

This study included 954 mother-newborn pairs. Methylation levels in the cord blood were determined using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850 K array platform. In utero exposure to diabetes was defined by the presence of maternal pregestational or gestational diabetes. Preterm birth was defined as gestational age at birth less than 37 weeks. Linear regression analysis was employed to identify differentially methylated CpG sites. Differentially methylated regions were identified using the DMRcate Package. 126 (13%) newborns were born to mothers with diabetes in pregnancy and 173 (18%) newborns were born preterm, while 41 newborns were born both preterm and to mothers with diabetes in pregnancy. Genomic-wide CpG analysis found that eighteen CpG sites in cord blood were differentially methylated by maternal diabetes status at an FDR threshold of 5%. These significant CpG sites were mapped to 12 known genes, one of which was annotated to gene Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II, DM Beta (HLA-DMB). Consistently, one of the two identified significant methylated regions overlapped with HLA-DMB. The identified differentially methylated CpG sites mediated the association between diabetes in pregnancy and preterm birth by 61%. In this US birth cohort, we found that maternal diabetes was associated with altered fetal DNA methylation patterns, which substantially explained the link between diabetes and preterm birth.","",""

Total hospital costs were €33,002,652 per year, and most of these costs were diabetes-associated (€28,151,381; 85.3%).

Technology use increased treatment costs significantly (5.9 - 15.3 times), but lower all-cause hospitalisation rates were observed. In all age groups, diabetes technology use influenced healthcare consumption, yet in adolescence usage decreased and consumption patterns changed. These findings suggest that contemporary hospital costs of children with diabetes of all ages are driven primarily by the treatment of diabetes, with technology use as an important additive factor.

Prevalence of DM is rapidly growing worldwide, affecting many individuals in both developing and developed countries. DM is correlated with the onset and development of complications with diabetic nephropathy (DN), diabetic cardiomyopathy (DC) and diabetic neuropathy being the most devastating pathological events. On the other hand, Nrf2 is a regulator for redox balance in cells and accounts for activation of antioxidant enzymes. Dysregulation of Nrf2 signaling has been shown in various human diseases such as DM. This review focuses on the role Nrf2 signaling in major diabetic complications and targeting Nrf2 for treatment of this disease. These three complications share similarities including the presence of oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrosis. Onset and development of fibrosis impairs organ function, while oxidative stress and inflammation can evoke damage to cells. Activation of Nrf2 signaling significantly dampens inflammation and oxidative damage, and is beneficial in retarding interstitial fibrosis in diabetic complications. SIRT1 and AMPK are among the predominant pathways to upregulate Nrf2 expression in the amelioration of DN, DC and diabetic neuropathy. Moreover, certain therapeutic agents such as resveratrol and curcumin, among others, have been employed in promoting Nrf2 expression to upregulate HO-1 and other antioxidant enzymes in the combat of oxidative stress in the face of DM.","",""

In patients ≥65 years, operative time, adult spinal deformity, BMI, insulin-dependent diabetes, female sex, ASA class 4 designation, inpatient status, age, African American/Black race, and preoperative hematocrit were predictive of NHD with p < 0.001. Several variables were distinguished as predictive for only one age group including ASA Class 2 designation in ages 45-64 and adult spinal deformity, ASA class 4 designation, and inpatient status for patients ≥65 years. Application of ML algorithms to the ACS-NSQIP dataset identified a number of highly predictive and age-adjusted variables for NHD. As age is a risk factor for NHD following spinal fusion, our findings may be useful in both guiding perioperative decision-making and recognizing unique predictors of NHD among specific age groups.","",""

Our data indicate that the two Cre lines that were used directly label adult islet somatostatin-producing ∂ cells, which precludes their use to assess whether β cells originate from duct cells. Furthermore, many labeled ∂ cells, which have an elongated neuron-like shape, were likely misclassified as β cells because insulin-somatostatin coimmunolocalizations were not used.

Femurs and calvaria (parietal region) from 20-week-old male rats are examined to probe bones formed both by endochondral and intramembranous ossification. Compared to the healthy controls, the LepR-deficient animals display significant alterations in femur microarchitecture and in calvarium morphology when analyzed by micro-computed X-ray tomography (micro-CT). In particular, shorter femurs with reduced bone volume, combined with thinner parietal bones and shorter sagittal suture, point towards a delay in the skeletal development of the LepR-deficient rodents. On the other hand, LepR-deficient animals and healthy controls display analogous bone matrix composition, which is assessed in terms of tissue mineral density by micro-CT, degree of mineralization by quantitative backscattered electron imaging, and various metrics extrapolated from Raman hyperspectral images. Some specific microstructural features, i.e., mineralized cartilage islands in the femurs and hyper-mineralized areas in the parietal bones, also show comparable distribution and characteristics in both groups. Overall, the altered bone microarchitecture in the LepR-deficient animals indicates compromised bone quality, despite the normal bone matrix composition. The delayed development is also consistent with observations in humans with congenic Lep/LepR deficiency, making this animal model a suitable candidate for translational research.","",""

DR has non-proliferative stages, characterized in part by retinal neuroinflammation and ischemia, and proliferative stages, characterized by retinal angiogenesis. Several systemic factors, including poor glycemic control, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, increase the risk of DR progression to vision-threatening stages. Identification of cellular or molecular targets in early DR events could allow more prompt interventions pre-empting DR progression to vision-threatening stages. Glia mediate homeostasis and repair. They contribute to immune surveillance and defense, cytokine and growth factor production and secretion, ion and neurotransmitter balance, neuroprotection, and, potentially, regeneration. Therefore, it is likely that glia orchestrate events throughout the development and progression of retinopathy. Understanding glial responses to products of diabetes-associated systemic dyshomeostasis may reveal novel insights into the pathophysiology of DR and guide the development of novel therapies for this potentially blinding condition. In this article, first, we review normal glial functions and their putative roles in the development of DR. We then describe glial transcriptome alterations in response to systemic circulating factors that are upregulated in patients with diabetes and diabetes-related comorbidities; namely glucose in hyperglycemia, angiotensin II in hypertension, and the free fatty acid palmitic acid in hyperlipidemia. Finally, we discuss potential benefits and challenges associated with studying glia as targets of DR therapeutic interventions. In vitro stimulation of glia with glucose, angiotensin II and palmitic acid suggests that: 1) astrocytes may be more responsive than other glia to these products of systemic dyshomeostasis; 2) the effects of hyperglycemia on glia are likely to be largely osmotic; 3) fatty acid accumulation may compound DR pathophysiology by promoting predominantly proinflammatory and proangiogenic transcriptional alterations of macro and microglia; and 4) cell-targeted therapies may offer safer and more effective avenues for DR treatment as they may circumvent the complication of pleiotropism in retinal cell responses. Although several molecules previously implicated in DR pathophysiology are validated in this review, some less explored molecules emerge as potential therapeutic targets. Whereas much is known regarding glial cell activation, future studies characterizing the role of glia in DR and how their activation is regulated and sustained (independently or as part of retinal cell networks) may help elucidate mechanisms of DR pathogenesis and identify novel drug targets for this blinding disease.","",""

Dapagliflozin (DAPA) and canagliflozin (CANA) are sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors used for T2DM, which is frequently comorbid with HCC. Three drugs are substrates of UGT1A9 isoenzyme. This study aimed to evaluate donafenib-dapagliflozin and donafenib-canagliflozin pharmacokinetic interactions and explore the potential mechanisms. Rats were divided into seven groups (n = 6) that received donafenib (1), dapagliflozin (2), canagliflozin (3), dapagliflozin and donafenib (4), canagliflozin and donafenib (5), donafenib and dapagliflozin (6), donafenib and canagliflozin (7). The concentrations of drugs were determined by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Multiple doses of dapagliflozin caused donafenib maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) to increase 37.01%. Canagliflozin increased donafenib Cmax 1.77-fold and the area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC0-t and AUCinf) 1.39- and 1.41-fold, respectively, while reducing the apparent clearance (CLz) 28.38%. Multiple doses of donafenib increased dapagliflozin AUC0-t 1.61-fold, AUCinf 1.77-fold, whereas its CLz reduced 40.50%. Furthermore, donafenib caused similar changes in canagliflozin pharmacokinetics. The PCR results demonstrated that dapagliflozin inhibited the mRNA expression of Ugt1a7 in liver and donafenib decreased the expression of Ugt1a7 mRNA in liver and intestine. Increased exposure to these drugs may be due to their metabolism inhibition mediated by Ugt1a7. These pharmacokinetic interactions observed in this study may be of clinical significance, which may help adjust dose properly and avoid toxicity effects in patients with HCC and T2DM.","",""

Firstly, considering that indirect links between microbes and diseases will be increased by introducing drug related associations, we construct a Microbe-Drug-Disease tripartite network through data processing from four databases including Human Microbe-Disease Association Database (HMDAD), Disbiome Database, Microbe-Drug Association Database (MDAD) and Comparative Toxicoge-nomics Database (CTD). Secondly, we construct similarity networks for microbes, diseases and drugs via microbe function similarity, disease semantic similarity and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, respectively. Based on the similarity networks, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to extract main features of nodes. These features will be input into the RGCN as initial features. Finally, based on the tripartite network and initial features, we design two-layer RGCN to predict microbe-disease associations. Experimental results indicate that TNRGCN achieves best performance in cross validation compared with other methods. Meanwhile, case studies for Type 2 diabetes (T2D), Bipolar disorder and Autism demonstrate the favorable effectiveness of TNRGCN in association prediction.","",""

This task is typically performed using a standard formula that, despite containing some patient-specific parameters, often leads to sub-optimal glucose control due to its poor personalization and lack of adaptation over time to tackle the intra-individual variability. To overcome the previous limitations, in this work we propose an individualized and adaptive mealtime insulin bolus calculator based on double deep Q-learning (DDQ), which is tailored to the patient thanks to a personalization procedure relying on a two-step learning framework. The proposed DDQ-learning bolus calculator was developed and tested using the UVA/Padova T1D simulator, which is equipped with a cohort of 100 diabetic virtual subjects, and able to reliably mimic real-world scenarios, by introducing multiple variability sources impacting glucose metabolism and technology. The learning phase included a long-term training of eight sub-population models, one for each representative subject, selected thanks to a clustering procedure applied to the training set. Then, for each subject of the testing set, a personalization procedure was performed, by initializing the models based on the cluster to which the patient belongs. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed bolus calculator on a 60-day simulation, using several metrics representing the goodness of glycemic control, and comparing the results with the standard guidelines for mealtime insulin dosing. The proposed method improved the time in target range from 68.35% to 70.08% and significantly reduced the time in hypoglycemia (from 8.78% to 4.17%). The overall glycemic risk index decreased from 8.2 to 7.3, indicating the benefit of our method when applied for insulin dosing compared to standard guidelines.","",""

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) among AS patients is higher than in the general population. DM significantly increases the risk of AS development and progression from mild to severe. The interplay between AS and DM's mechanism is not entirely known yet. The increased accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) was linked to increased valvular oxidative stress, inflammation, expression of coagulation factors, and signs of calcification, according to an analysis of aortic stenotic valves. It is interesting to note that in diabetic AS patients, valvular inflammation did not correlate with serum glucose levels but rather only with long-term glycemic management markers like glycated haemoglobin and fructosamine. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement, which has been shown to be safer than surgical aortic valve replacement, is advantageous for AS patients who also have concurrent diabetes. Additionally, novel anti-diabetic medications have been proposed to lower the risk of AS development in DM patients, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that target reduction of AGEs-mediated oxidative stress. There are little data on the effects of hyperglycemia on valvular calcification, but understanding the interactions between them is essential to develop a successful treatment strategy to stop or at least slow the progression of AS in DM patients. There is a link among AS and DM and that DM negatively impacts the quality of life and longevity of AS patients. The sole successful treatment, despite ongoing efforts to find new therapeutic modalities, involves aortic valve replacement. More research is required to find methods that can slow the advancement of these conditions, enhancing the prognosis and course of people with AS and DM.","",""

Both groups showed decreased SIT and TBUT values on postoperative Day 7, after which they gradually improved. SIT and TBUT values in diabetics were significantly lower than that in non-diabetics postoperatively (P < 0.001). SIT in non-diabetics reached baseline levels at postoperative 3 months. OSDI scores reached peak levels in both groups on postoperative Day 7, but were higher in diabetics than non-diabetics (P < 0.001). OSDI scores gradually improved over 3 months but remained over baseline levels in both groups. Corneal staining was positive in 22% diabetics and 8% non-diabetics at postoperative Day 7. However, none of the patients had corneal staining at 3 months. Tear meniscus height (TMH) did not reveal any significant difference between the two groups at any time interval. We concluded that tear film dysfunction after clear corneal incision occurs in both groups, but is more severe and recovers more slowly in diabetics than non-diabetics.","",""

This study was therefore performed to assess the effect of the various factors on the tear film function and ocular surface in GDM using different diagnostic tests. Case-control study includes 49 subjects after calculating the sample size. Cases of newly diagnosed GDM in their second or third trimester of pregnancy without any ocular or systemic comorbidities. The following standard tests were performed, namely, ocular surface disease index (OSDI) scoring, Schirmer's test, tear film breakup time (TBUT), and ocular surface staining (SICCA). The two study groups did not differ significantly in terms of age, gestational age, and presenting symptoms.

The available treatment modalities primarily target the acquired symptoms of DED including tear film supplements, anti-inflammatory drugs, mucin secretagogues, etc., However, the underlying etiology is still an area of active research, especially in regard to the diverse etiology and symptoms. Proteomics is a robust approach that has been playing major role in understanding the causative mechanism and biochemical changes in DED by identifying the changes in protein expression profile in tears. Tears are a complex fluid composed of several biomolecules such as proteins, peptides, lipids, mucins, and metabolites secreted from lacrimal gland, meibomian gland, cornea, and vascular sources. Over the past two decades, tears have emerged as a bona-fide source for biomarker identification in many ocular conditions because of the minimally invasive and simple sample collection procedure. However, the tear proteome can be altered by several factors, which increases the complexity of the approach. The recent advancements in untargeted mass spectrometry-based proteomics could overcome such shortcomings. Also, these technological advancements help to distinguish the DED profiles based on its association with other complications such as Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and meibomian gland dysfunction. This review summarizes the important molecular profiles found in proteomics studies to be altered in DED which have added to the understanding of its pathogenesis.","",""

We collected information available on databases and specialized literature to construct regulatory networks of VAT resident cells, such as adipocytes, CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophages. These networks were used to build stochastic models based on Markov chains to visualize phenotypic changes on VAT resident cells under several physiological contexts, including obesity and diabetes mellitus. Stochastic models showed that in lean people, insulin produces inflammation in adipocytes as a homeostatic mechanism to downregulate glucose intake. However, when the VAT tolerance to inflammation is exceeded, adipocytes lose insulin sensitivity according to severity of the inflammatory condition. Molecularly, insulin resistance is initiated by inflammatory pathways and sustained by intracellular ceramide signaling. Furthermore, our data show that insulin resistance potentiates the effector response of immune cells, which suggests its role in the mechanism of nutrient redirection. Finally, our models show that insulin resistance cannot be inhibited by anti-inflammatory therapies alone. Insulin resistance controls adipocyte glucose intake under homeostatic conditions. However, metabolic alterations such as obesity, enhances insulin resistance in adipocytes, redirecting nutrients to immune cells, permanently sustaining local inflammation in the VAT.","",""

A total of 30 Wistar rats (Rattus novergicus) induced with DM and traumatic ulcers on the lower lip mucosa were divided into six groups-three each for control and treatment groups. Control groups were treated with CMC 5% gel, and treatment groups were administered with C. limon peel essential oil gel. The expression of VEGF and CD-31 was observed on days 5, 7, and 9. Immunohistochemical examinations were performed with the monoclonal antibodies anti-VEGF and anti-CD-31. ANOVA was conducted to analyze the differences between the groups (p < 0.05). An increase in VEGF and CD-31 expression in the treatment group was observed compared with that of the control group (p < 0.05). Citrus limon peel essential oil gel increased VEGF and CD-31 expression during the healing process of traumatic ulcers in diabetes-afflicted Wistar rats.","",""

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the acute effects of WSSP on blood glucose homeostasis under normal conditions and the underlying mechanisms. Three fractions of WSSP (≤10, 10-50, and >50 kDa) were obtained via ultracentrifugation. Rats were subjected to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after a single administration of WSSP. The insulin tolerance test (ITT) and pyruvate tolerance test (PTT) were performed to evaluate insulin sensitivity and gluconeogenesis, respectively. Single WSSP administration markedly reduced blood glucose levels as revealed by the OGTT. Serum insulin levels were not increased by WSSP treatment. Blood glucose levels during ITT were significantly reduced due to WSSP treatment. WSSP treatment activated the phosphorylation of Akt, thereby activating insulin signaling in the skeletal muscles and liver. The ≤10 kDa fraction considerably reduced blood glucose levels per the OGTT and ITT. In contrast, gluconeogenesis in PTT and the expression of key enzymes in hepatocytes were suppressed by the >50 kDa fraction. This study demonstrated that WSSP acutely reduced postprandial blood glucose levels by improving insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscles in normal rats, which was attributed to constituents with a molecular weight of ≤10 kDa. Moreover, WSSP treatment suppressed gluconeogenesis in the liver, for which constituents of >50 kDa were responsible. Thus, WSSP can acutely regulate blood glucose homeostasis via multiple mechanisms. Since postprandial hyperglycemia leads to the onset of T2DM, WSSP, as a functional food, may possess potential active compounds that prevent T2DM.","",""

The diagnosis is established on the assessment of gastric function that confirms delayed gastric emptying in the absence of structural etiologies. This study aimed to detect gastroparesis-related clinical symptoms early in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), investigate the concomitant risk factors, and evaluate the prevalence. Methodology This study was conducted at the Department of Medicine and Diabetes Outdoor Clinic of Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Rahim Yar Khan from February 13, 2022, to February 11, 2023. The study involved 175 patients with T2DM who reported gastroparesis-related symptoms. The demographic and clinical characteristics, symptom severity, complications, related risk factors, duration of disease, medications, body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels were assessed. The severity of diabetic gastroparesis was established using the disease-specific Patient Assessment of Gastrointestinal Disorders-Symptom Severity Index (PAGI-SYM) and the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI). The five-point scale of the PAGI-SYM and the four-degree severity scores of GCSI were assessed. Neuropathy disability scores and motor evacuation functions were analyzed. Data were analyzed from these questionnaires, special proforma, and patient interviews. Results The clinical features of diabetic gastroparesis were observed in 44% of T2DM patients with mild-grade gastroparesis in 38 (21.7%), moderate in 30 (17.1%), and severe-grade gastroparesis-related symptoms in nine (5.2%) patients. The main manifestations were early satiety (45.1%), stomach fullness (44.5%), bloating (38.3%), and nausea (33.1%). Diabetic gastroparesis symptoms were considerably linked to disease duration of more than 10 years (p = 0.02), high HbA1c (p = 0.001), increased fasting blood glucose (p = 0.003), polyneuropathy, cigarette smoking, and history of comorbid conditions (p = 0.009). Obesity and the female gender were the forecasters of the manifestation of at least one cardinal gastroparesis symptom. Conclusions Gastric emptying is significant in the pathogenesis of gastroparesis-related symptoms. Disease duration of more than 10 years, poor glycemic control with hyperglycemia, high HbA1C, polyneuropathy, and cigarette smoking must be considered as predictors for early detection and risk factors for the advancement of gastroparesis in T2DM. Gastroparesis-related common symptoms of early satiety, bloating, and stomach fullness were considerably linked to the additional risk factors of hypercholesteremia, chronic microvascular complications, concomitant cardiovascular diseases, and a positive family history of diabetes mellitus. There was no relationship between BMI, age, types of treatment, and the degree of gastroparesis severity. The prevalence and severity of gastroparesis symptoms were particularly high among obese females with poor glycemic control and longer disease duration.","",""

Additionally, we also found that PM women, but not EM women, were linked with an increased risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. However, this is not in line with the conclusion that both PM and EM had a higher risk of total stroke. Women with PM or EM have a higher risk of developing long-term CVD, compared to women with menopause at age >45 years.

Protocatechuic acid (PCA) is a phenolic acid widely distributed in garlic, onion, cauliflower and other plant-based foods. Given the anti-oxidative effects of PCA in vitro, we hypothesized that PCA would also have direct beneficial effects on endothelial function in addition to the systemic effects on vascular health demonstrated by previous studies. Since IL-1β is the major pathological contributor to endothelial dysfunction in diabetes, the anti-inflammatory effects of PCA specific on endothelial cells were further verified by the use of IL-1β-induced inflammation model. Direct incubation of db/db mouse aortas with physiological concentration of PCA significantly ameliorated endothelium-dependent relaxation impairment, as well as reactive oxygen species overproduction mediated by diabetes. In addition to the well-studied anti-oxidative activity, PCA demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the pro-inflammatory cytokines MCP1, VCAM1 and ICAM1, as well as increasing the phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt in the inflammatory endothelial cell model induced by the key player in diabetic endothelial dysfunction IL-1β. Upon blocking of Akt phosphorylation, p-eNOS/eNOS remained low and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines by PCA ceased.

Since oxidative stress plays an important role in spermatogenesis and fertility in male populations, this study evaluated the role of ethanolic extract of C. borivilianum roots in epididymal sperm maturation against adversities posed by ionizing gamma irradiation. Materials and methods: Antioxidant potential of C. borivilianum root extract (CRE) was evaluated through DPPH (2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl) and NO (nitric oxide) scavenging assays. Four groups of healthy Swiss albino mice were constituted, which were labeled as follows: Group I: sham control, Group II: 7-day pre-treatment with 50 mg/kg CRE, Group III: 6 Gy irradiation without pre-treatment, and Group IV: 7-day pre-treatment with 50 mg/kg CRE and 6 Gy irradiation on day 7.

Finally, quantitative real‑time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to verify key target genes. Our results revealed that 9 main targets (RELA, JNK1, PTEN, VEGFA, EGF, ERK2, CASP3, AKT1, MMP9) were recognized as key therapeutic targets with excellent binding affinity screened by database analysis and molecular docking. The biological processes were identified by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, which appeared mainly involved in the positive regulation of cell proliferation as well as the negative regulation of apoptosis. The verification experiments in vitro revealed that fermented CS significantly attenuated the HG-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, and promoted the proliferation of HK-2 cells. Moreover, fermented CS significantly downregulated the expressions of Bax, Caspase-3, VEGFA, P-AKT and P-ERK, and upregulated the expression of PTEN compared with that of HG group. Our results demonstrate that the fermented CS has nephroprotective effects significantly, which functions via promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis of renal proximal tubular cells, likely by targeting Caspase-3, Bax, VEGFA and PTEN. Furthermore, AKT and ERK signaling pathway may be the critical mechanisms underlying the efficacy of fermented CS in DKD treatment.","",""

A literature review regarding GDM and GTD was carried out with particular interest on meta-analyses and human studies dealing with the (i) shared risk factors between GDM and GTD, (ii) the epidemiological link between GTD and GDM, (iii) physiopathologic link between GTD and GDM, (iv) clinical consequences of GDM and GTD, and (v) post-partum implications of GDM and GTD. The association between GDM and GTD is common and may be explained by the insulin-resistance state due to maternal GTD, to alterations in the placentation process or to the many shared risk factors. Discrepant results of epidemiologic studies can be explained, at least in part, by the changes in diagnostic criteria and screening strategies throughout the years for both conditions. GDM and GTD impact pregnancy outcome and have post-partum long-term consequences, but more studies are needed to prove an additional adverse effect. Based on the epidemiological and physio-pathological link between GDM and GTD, it could be suggested that a diagnosis of GTD could lead to screen GDM and the other way round.","",""

Adults (N = 209, 58 ± 10 years, 34.8 ± 4.7 kg m-2) at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes were randomized to one of three groups (2:2:1): iTRE (30% energy requirements between 0800 and 1200 hours and followed by a 20-h fasting period on three nonconsecutive days per week, and ad libitum eating on other days); CR (70% of energy requirements daily, without time prescription); or standard care (weight loss booklet). This open-label, parallel group, three-arm randomized controlled trial provided nutritional support to participants in the iTRE and CR arms for 6 months, with an additional 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome was change in glucose area under the curve in response to a mixed-meal tolerance test at month 6 in iTRE versus CR. Glucose tolerance was improved to a greater extent in iTRE compared with CR (-10.10 (95% confidence interval -14.08, -6.11) versus -3.57 (95% confidence interval -7.72, 0.57) mg dl-1 min-1; P = 0.03) at month 6, but these differences were lost at month 18.

Sox11 ((sex determining region Y)-box 11) was selected to confirm its roles in regulating insulin secretion, and the gene was subjected to shRNA-mediated suppression. While Sox11 overexpression decreased GSIS, its suppression increased GSIS, confirming the role of Sox11 as a negative regulator of insulin secretion. Furthermore, metabolic experiments using radiolabelled glucose showed Sox11 to participate in regulating glucose metabolism. Our data suggested that overexpression screening is a feasible option for systemic functional testing to identify important genes in GSIS.","",""

Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Ovid Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central up to 14 October 2022.

Trials systematically comparing combinations of more than one drug treatment class with no drug, subgroup analyses of randomised controlled trials, and non-English language studies were deemed ineligible. Certainty of evidence was assessed following the GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation) approach. The analysis identified 816 trials with 471 038 patients, together evaluating 13 different drug classes; all subsequent estimates refer to the comparison with standard treatments. Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.94; high certainty) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (0.88, 0.82 to 0.93; high certainty) reduce all cause death; non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, so far tested only with finerenone in patients with chronic kidney disease, probably reduce mortality (0.89, 0.79 to 1.00; moderate certainty); other drugs may not. The study confirmed the benefits of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in reducing cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, admission to hospital for heart failure, and end stage kidney disease. Finerenone probably reduces admissions to hospital for heart failure and end stage kidney disease, and possibly cardiovascular death. Only GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce non-fatal stroke; SGLT-2 inhibitors are superior to other drugs in reducing end stage kidney disease. GLP-1 receptor agonists and probably SGLT-2 inhibitors and tirzepatide improve quality of life. Reported harms were largely specific to drug class (eg, genital infections with SGLT-2 inhibitors, severe gastrointestinal adverse events with tirzepatide and GLP-1 receptor agonists, hyperkalaemia leading to admission to hospital with finerenone). Tirzepatide probably results in the largest reduction in body weight (mean difference -8.57 kg; moderate certainty). Basal insulin (mean difference 2.15 kg; moderate certainty) and thiazolidinediones (mean difference 2.81 kg; moderate certainty) probably result in the largest increases in body weight.

SEP was measured as a latent variable consisting of household income and individual educational attainment. Mediators included smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes and hypertension. The primary outcome was CVD morbidity and mortality, defined as the first fatal/nonfatal CVD event during follow-up (median 6.2 years). Generalized structural equation modeling tested the mediating effects of modifiable risk factors in associations between SEP and CVD in the total population and stratified by sex. Lower SEP was associated with 2.5 times increased odds of CVD morbidity and mortality (OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 2.28, 2.76). Modifiable risk factors mediated 74% of associations between SEP and CVD morbidity and mortality in the total population and were more important mediators of associations in females (83%) than males (62%). Smoking mediated these associations independently and jointly with other mediators. The mediating effects of physical inactivity were through joint mediating effects with obesity, diabetes or hypertension. There were additional joint mediating effects of obesity through diabetes or hypertension in females.

The aim of this study was to evaluate if extended inpatient monitoring of postpartum patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy for at least 36 hours after their last blood pressure that was ≥150 systolic blood pressure or 100 diastolic blood pressure would improve readmission rates for preeclampsia with severe features within 6 weeks of delivery. We performed a retrospective cohort study in patients with a singleton gestation and a diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy at their delivery admission or at any point during pregnancy who delivered 1 year prior and 1 year after the implementation of extended inpatient monitoring of postpartum hypertension. The primary outcome was readmission for preeclampsia with severe features within 6 weeks of delivery. Secondary outcomes were length of stay during first admission, number of readmissions for any indication, intensive care unit admission, postpartum day at readmission, median systolic blood pressure in the 24-hour period prior to discharge, median diastolic blood pressure in the 24-hour period prior to discharge, intravenous antihypertensive medication required during first admission, and intravenous antihypertensive medication required during second admission.

Multivariable analysis was performed adjusting for baseline maternal characteristic differences between exposure groups. 567 patients met inclusion criteria of which 248 patients delivered prior and 319 delivered after the implementation of extended monitoring. For baseline characteristics, compared to the pre-intervention group, the extended monitoring group had a significantly higher proportion of patients who were non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic, more diagnoses of hypertensive disorders and/or diabetes at the time of admission for delivery, a difference in the distribution of hypertensive diagnoses at the time of discharge from the first admission, and fewer were discharged from their first admission on labetalol.

Therefore, targeting PPARγ with natural ligands is advantageous and promising approach for the better management of T2DM. The present research aimed to assess the antidiabetic potential of phenolics Phloretin (PTN) and Phlorizin (PZN) type 2 diabetic mice. In silico docking was performed to check the effect of PTN and PZN on PPARγ S273-Cdk5 interactions. The docking results were further validated in preclinical settings by utilizing a mice model of high fat diet-induced T2DM. Computational docking and further MD-simulation data revealed that PTN and PZN inhibited the activation of Cdk5, thereby blocking the phosphorylation of PPARγ. Our in vivo results further demonstrated that PTN and PZN administration significantly improved the secretory functions of adipocytes by increasing adiponectin and reducing inflammatory cytokine levels, which ultimately reduced the hyperglycaemic index. Additionally, combined treatment of PTN and PZN decreased in vivo adipocyte expansion and increased Glut4 expression in adipose tissues. Furthermore, PTN and PZN treatment reduced hepatic insulin resistance by modulating lipid metabolism and inflammatory markers. In summary, our findings strongly imply that PTN and PZN are candidates as nutraceuticals in the management of comorbidities related to diabetes and its complications.","",""

Nutrigenomics, the study of how genes and food components interact, looks into diet-altering disease development by modulating processes involved with the onset, progression, and severity of disease. These factors affecting the development of these chronic diseases are thought to be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, which are heritable and reversible, and carry genetic information without changing the nucleotide sequence of the genome and are also mediated by maternal and postnatal nutrition.","",""

Two approaches are used to derive them: the index-based and data-driven approaches, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Studies on diet-disease relationships are now concentrated on DPs. Most available studies are in adults, which emphasize the role of DPs as contributors to certain chronic diseases like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and certain cancers. Only few studies were conducted among children, mostly using a data-driven approach and population specific. The available studies identify associations with some diseases like obesity, neurobehavioral disorders, asthma, and cardiometabolic markers. Tracking of DP consumption from early childhood to later life stages including adulthood has been shown from longitudinal studies to predict certain cardiometabolic risk factors and adiposity that may predispose to certain diseases later in life. The influences of sociodemographic factors, most especially maternal education, have predictive effects on adherence to certain DPs, whether the ""healthy"" or ""unhealthy"" type.

We measured the willingness of the free mouse to liberate the confined mouse under diverse metabolic conditions. Around 42% of ad libitum-fed mice exhibited a helping behavior, as evidenced by the reduction in the latencies to release the trapped cagemate. This behavior was independent of subsequent social contact reward and was associated with changes in corticosterone indicative of emotional contagion. This decision-making process was coupled with reduced blood glucose excursions and higher Adenosine triphosphate (ATP):Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ratios in the forebrain of helper mice, suggesting that it was a highly energy-demanding process. Interestingly, chronic (food restriction and type 2 diabetes) and acute (chemogenetic activation of hunger-promoting AgRP neurons) situations mimicking organismal negative energy balance and enhanced appetite attenuated helping behavior toward a distressed conspecific. To investigate similar effects in humans, we estimated the influence of glycated hemoglobin (a surrogate of long-term glycemic control) on prosocial behavior (namely charity donation) using the Understanding Society dataset. Our results evidenced that organismal energy status markedly influences helping behavior and that hypothalamic AgRP neurons are at the interface of metabolism and prosocial behavior.","",""

This study aimed to analyze feasibility of teleophthalmology service for diseases diagnosis and referral in remote areas of Taiwan. Methods: A retrospective study of medical records from 11 remote teleophthalmology clinics in the Taitung area of Taiwan was conducted from May 2020 to December 2021. Vision and intraocular pressure were checked. Ophthalmic imaging was performed by local trained nurses using a hand-held ophthalmoscope and slit lamp biomicroscope. The images were transmitted by telemedicine system to a medical center. Consultation was conducted via face-to-face real-time video calls. Ophthalmologists in the medical center provided diagnosis and treatment advice based on the real-time images and interactive history taking via the telemedicine system. All the images and data were collected and well-reviewed by ophthalmologists in the medical center, and disease prevalence and referral were analyzed for the program. A small-scale satisfaction questionnaire survey was conducted for efficacy evaluation of the program. Results: A total of 1,401 medical records from 1,094 patients were collected and screened. Patients' ages ranged from 9 months to 94 years, with a mean age of 57.27 (standard deviation ±20.47) years. The most frequent ophthalmologic diagnosis was dry eye disease (20.2%), followed by conjunctivitis (12.4%). Among 322 patients with underlying diseases of diabetes mellitus, 59 patients (18.3%) were diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy. Major diagnosis was made in 102 patients (7.3%) and referral to hospital for further management was suggested. This program had high overall satisfaction score of 89% (mean 4.43 ± 0.52 points) in satisfaction questionnaire survey. Conclusion: Teleophthalmology provides an alternative tool for ocular disease diagnosis and screening for patients in remote areas, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This service helps to detect major but undiagnosed diseases and promotes health care accessibility and availability in remote areas that lack specialists.","",""

There is as such no organized cultivation in India, and the plant is still being collected from the wild for their therapeutic uses. It is, therefore, important to estimate the genetic diversity and population genetic structure of G. sylvestre to ascertain the genetically diverse germplasm. The present study, therefore, was undertaken to analyze the genetic variability in 118 accessions belonging to 11 wild populations of G. sylvestre using directed amplification of minisatellite-region DNA (DAMD) and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR). The present genetic analyses of 11 populations with 25 markers (8 DAMD and 17 ISSR) revealed significant genetic diversity (H = 0.26, I = 0.40, PPL = 80.89%) at a species level, while the average genetic diversity at the population level was low. Among the 11 populations studied, PCH and UTK populations showed maximum genetic diversity, followed by KNR and AMB, while TEL population revealed the lowest genetic diversity. AMOVA and Gst values (0.18) revealed that most of the genetic variations are found within populations and very less among populations, and higher gene flow (Nm = 2.29) was found to be responsible for the genetic homogenization of the populations. The clustering pattern resulting from the UPGMA dendrogram was in congruence with STRUCTURE and PCoA, segregating all the 11 populations into two main genetic clusters: cluster I (populations of North and Central India) and cluster II (populations of South India). The clustering patterns obtained from all three statistical methods indicate that the genetic structure in G. sylvestre populations corresponds to the geographical diversity of the populations and represents a strong genetic structure. The genetically diverse populations identified during the present study could be a potential genetic resource for further prospecting and conserving this important plant resource.","",""

We expected the attention mechanism in Transformer to reveal a hint of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, and performed a comparative study to determine whether Transformer was effective in the classification and regression of glucose. Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia rarely occur and this results in an imbalance in the classification. We built a data augmentation model using the generative adversarial network.

Here, We addressed the potential contribution of gut microbiota in mediating this favourable surgical outcome by using an established preclinical model of RYGB. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that RYGB-treated Zucker fatty rats had altered fecal composition of various bacteria at the phylum and species levels, including lower fecal abundance of an unidentified Erysipelotrichaceae species, compared with both sham-operated (Sham) and body weight-matched to RYGB-treated (BWM) rats. Correlation analysis further revealed that fecal abundance of this unidentified Erysipelotrichaceae species linked with multiple indices of glycemic control uniquely in RYGB-treated rats. Sequence alignment of this Erysipelotrichaceae species identified Longibaculum muris to be the most closely related species, and its fecal abundance positively correlated with oral glucose intolerance in RYGB-treated rats. In fecal microbiota transplant experiments, the improved oral glucose tolerance of RYGB-treated compared with BWM rats could partially be transferred to recipient germfree mice, independently of body weight. Unexpectedly, providing L. muris as a supplement to RYGB recipient mice further improved oral glucose tolerance, while administering L. muris alone to chow-fed or Western style diet-challenged conventionally raised mice had minimal metabolic impact. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that the gut microbiota contributes to weight loss-independent improvements in glycemic control after RYGB and demonstrate how correlation of a specific gut microbiota species with a host metabolic trait does not imply causation. IMPORTANCE Metabolic surgery remains the most effective treatment modality for severe obesity and its comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a commonly performed type of metabolic surgery that reconfigures gastrointestinal anatomy and profoundly remodels the gut microbiota. While it is clear that RYGB is superior to dieting when it comes to improving glycemic control, the extent to which the gut microbiota contributes to this effect remains untested. In the present study, we uniquely linked fecal Erysipelotrichaceae species, including Longibaculum muris, with indices of glycemic control after RYGB in genetically obese and glucose-intolerant rats. We further show that the weight loss-independent improvements in glycemic control in RYGB-treated rats can be transmitted via their gut microbiota to germfree mice. Our findings provide rare causal evidence that the gut microbiota contributes to the health benefits of metabolic surgery and have implications for the development of gut microbiota-based treatments for type 2 diabetes.","",""

The global NAFLD prevalence in adolescents increased from 3.73% in 1990 to 4.71% in 2019 (relative increase of 26.27%). The prevalence for males and females was 5.84% and 3.52% in 2019, respectively. The Oceanian and North American continents had the highest adolescent NAFLD prevalence (median 6.54% and 5.64%, respectively), whereas Europe had the lowest prevalence (median 3.98%). South and North America had the highest relative increase in adolescent NAFLD prevalence from 1990-2019 (median 39.25% and 36.87%, respectively). High body-mass index (BMI) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) increased significantly in adolescents worldwide. However, only high BMI and not T2DM correlated with NAFLD prevalence in adolescents globally. Countries with higher HDIs had larger increases in adolescent NAFLD prevalence from 1990-2019, although countries with the highest HDIs (HDI > 0.9) had the lowest NAFLD prevalence in 2019. NAFLD in adolescents is an increasing health problem on all continents. Improving environmental factors, including lifestyle but also healthcare policies, can help to prevent NAFLD from developing in children and adolescents and help to improve outcomes in children and adolescents with NAFLD.","",""

Additionally, the BET was used to calculate the surface area, which came out to be 119.12 m2 /g. Since the true effects of new pollutants, including medicines, on the environment and human health are not well understood, their presence in aquatic systems poses a severe hazard. For this reason, the antibiotic Ibuprofen (IBP) was absorbable to ZnO-NPs in this search. As opposed to fitting to Langmuir isothermally, the adsorption process was discovered to be pseudo-second-order kinetically, and the reaction was determined to be a chemisorption process. The process was endothermic and spontaneous, according to thermodynamic studies. Maximizing IBP removal from aqueous solution required the use of a Box-Behnken surface statistical design with four components, four levels, and response surface modelling. Solution pH, IBP concentration, duration, and dose were the four parameters that were utilized. The regeneration process, which is employed for five cycles with excellent efficiency, is the best benefit of using ZnO-NPs. Examine the elimination of pollutants from actual samples as well. However, the adsorbent is quite effective at reducing biological activity. At high concentrations of ZnO-NPs demonstrated notable antioxidant activity and RBC hemocompatibility and no discernible hemolysis was seen. ZnO-NPs demonstrated a notable percent suppression of α-amylase up to 53.6 % at 400 μg/mL, and so displayed potential as an antidiabetic. Cyclooxygenase was suppressed by ZnO-NPs in an anti-inflammatory test (COX-1 & COX-2) up to 56.32 and 52.04 % at a concentration of 400 μg/mL, respectively. Significant anti-Alzheimer potential was demonstrated by ZnO-NPs at 400 μg/mL by inhibiting Acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) and Butyl cholinesterase (BChE) up to 68.98 ± 1.62% and 62.36% respectively. We came to the conclusion that guava extract is helpful for ZnO-NP reduction and capping. The bioengineered nanoparticles could prevent Alzheimer's, diabetes, and inflammation and were biocompatible.

Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the its Bromelain's impact in diabetic periodontitis in terms of inflammation and senescence activity. We assessed the wound healing capacity, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and senescence marker p16 in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) in response to Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) stimulant, with or without Bromelain treatment. The expression of p65, p-ERK, and p-p38 were also examined to elucidate whether Bromelain's anti-inflammaging activity is mediated through NF-κB and MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Bromelain concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 20 g/mL had no adverse effect on HGF cell proliferation. Bromelain improved wound healing in HGFs with AGEs stimulation. In addition, Bromelain suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 in HGFs elicited by AGEs. Meanwhile, Bromelain treatment also inhibited the senescence activity and expression of p16 in AGEs-stimulated HGFs. Western blot analysis indicated that the upregulation of p-ERK, p-p38 and p65 induced by AGEs were inhibited by Bromelain in HGFs. These data suggest that excessive AGEs in the gingiva may lead to the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and marked senescence activity. Bromelain application may be helpful in enhancing wound healing by suppressing inflammaging via downregulation of NF-κB and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways in DM individuals with periodontal disease.","",""

Gene expression levels were detected by RT-PCR. The protein level was detected by western blotting. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay. To investigate the role of MYDGF, the plasmid was transfected into fibroblasts. The expression levels of cytokines were determined by ELISA. High glucose can down-regulate the expression of MYDGF in human gingival fibroblasts in a time-dependent manner, and decrease the fibroblast activity. SOD level was decreased and MDA level was increased in gingival fibroblasts by high glucose. High glucose up-regulates pro-apoptotic indicator Bax, down-regulates anti-apototic indicator Bcl-2, and increased endoplasmic reticulum stress related indicators Nox 2, GRP78, ATF6, and PERK. In addition, high glucose increased TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8 and CXCL1 protein levels in fibroblasts. Our study also found that high glucose inhibits the AKT signaling pathway and activates the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. Interestingly, overexpression of MYDGF reversed these effects. MYDGF is down-regulated in gingival fibroblasts induced by high glucose. Overexpression of MYDGF inhibits apoptosis induced by high glucose, inhibits oxidative stress and cytokine secretion of gingival fibroblasts induced by high glucose, and induces AKT pathway activation and NF-κB pathway inhibition.","",""

Following that, we examined the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 to see if vitamin D was able to modulate the anti-oxidant signaling. A knockdown experiment was then conducted to proof the participation of Nrf2 on the secretion of pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-8. : Following the treatment of vitamin D, AGEs-elicited IL-6 and IL-8 production and cell senescence were dose-dependently repressed. Moreover, vitamin D attenuated AGEs-induced ROS in a dose-dependent pattern. Results from qRT-PCR demonstrated vitamin D reversed the suppression of Nrf2 and HO-1 induced by AGEs. Our findings revealed that the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effect in vitamin D was mediated via the upregulation of Nrf2 expression. : These data showed that high levels of AGEs in the gingiva lead to inflammaging reflected by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, cell senescence expression and oxidative stress. Vitamin D supplementation can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation via the upregulation of Nrf2 signaling and hence, may be a potential approach for treatment of diabetes-associated periodontitis.","",""

Sodium glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) emphasize this mechanism, promoting persistent glycosuria and natriuresis, but also induce a greater reduction of interstitial fluids than traditional diuretics. The preservation of osmotic homeostasis is the main task of the antidiuretic system and, in turn, intracellular dehydration the main drive to vasopressin (AVP) secretion. Copeptin is a stable fragment of the AVP precursor co-secreted with AVP in an equimolar amount. To investigate the copeptin adaptive response to SGLT2i, as well as the induced changes in body fluid distribution in T2DM patients. The GliRACo study was a prospective, multicenter, observational research. Twenty-six consecutive adult patients with T2DM were recruited and randomly assigned to empagliflozin or dapagliflozin treatment. Copeptin, plasma renin activity, aldosterone and natriuretic peptides were evaluated at baseline (T0) and then 30 (T30) and 90 days (T90) after SGLT2i starting. Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were performed at T0 and T90. Among endocrine biomarkers, only copeptin increased at T30, showing subsequent stability (7.5 pmol/L at T0, 9.8 pmol/L at T30, 9.5 pmol/L at T90; p = 0.001). BIVA recorded an overall tendency to dehydration at T90 with a stable proportion between extra- and intracellular fluid volumes. Twelve patients (46.1%) had a BIVA overhydration pattern at baseline and 7 of them (58.3%) resolved this condition at T90. Total body water content, extra and intracellular fluid changes were significantly affected by the underlying overhydration condition (p < 0.001), while copeptin did not. In patients with T2DM, SGLT2i promote the release of AVP, thus compensating for persistent osmotic diuresis. This mainly occurs because of a proportional dehydration process between intra and extracellular fluid (i.e., intracellular dehydration rather than extracellular dehydration). The extent of fluid reduction, but not the copeptin response, is affected by the patient's baseline volume conditions. Clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT03917758.","",""

Although some studies have examined the results of these techniques, there are no reports that compare these treatments and perform a multifactorial analysis. Methods  The study retrospectively examined 28 patients comprising 9 women and 19 men with an average age of 49.8 years (range: 16-72 years) who were treated for nonunion of long bones between April 2007 and November 2018. The patients were divided into two cohorts: group A had 17 patients treated with VBGs (9 patients treated with MFCF and 8 with FF), while group B had 11 patients treated with ICG. The following parameters were analyzed: radiographic patterns of nonunion, trauma energy, fracture exposure, associated fractures, previous surgeries, diabetes, smoking, age, and donor-site morbidity. Results  VBGs improved the healing rate (HR) by 9.42 times more than the nonvascularized grafts. Treatment with VBGs showed a 25% decrease in healing time. Diabetes increased the infection rate by 4.25 times. Upper limbs showed 70% lower infection rate. Smoking among VBG patients was associated with a 75% decrease in the HR, and diabetes was associated with an 80% decrease. Conclusion  This study reports the highest success rates in VBGs. The MFCFs seem to allow better clinical and radiological outcomes with less donor-site morbidity than FFs.","",""

The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on blood glucose control in Arabic people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Secondary aim was to compare the responses between the two vaccines approved for use in Kuwait. This retrospective study compared ambulatory glucose metrics, using a continuous glucose monitoring device, measured for 14 days before, and 7 days and 14 days after, the first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in Arabic people with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). We also explored possible links with vaccine type and other clinical characteristics. Glucose metrics calculated were time in range (TIR, 3.9-10 mmol/L), time above range (TAR, 10.1- 13.9 mmol/L or >13.9 mmol/L), time below range (TBR, 3- 3.9 mmol/L or <3 mmol/L) and glucose variability (CV). We enrolled 223 participants in the study. Over the 7 days period after the first vaccination dose there was a decrease in TIR (mean difference (SD) -1.9% ± 14.8%; p = 0.05) and increase in TAR >10 mmol/L (2.2% ± 15.9%; p = 0.04), with no effects on TBR. These effects were not seen after the second dose or 14 days after either dose. There was a decrease in CV over the 7 days period after the first (-1.2% ± 7.4%; p = 0.02) and second vaccine doses (-1.1% ± 6.9%; p = 0.03), with no effects noted 14 days after either dose. In subgroup analysis similar effects on TIR and TAR were also seen in those who had received the viral vector-based vaccine, but not the mRNA-based vaccine, although the decrease in CV was seen in those who had received the mRNA based vaccine but not the viral vector-based vaccine. We found a temporary impairment in glucose control in the first 7 days, particularly among individuals receiving viral vector vaccines. The group receiving mRNA vaccine was likely to experience an increase in glucose levels above the target range. However, the temporary change in metrics appears to return to pre-vaccination levels after one-week post-vaccination. The effects on glycemic parameters were more neutral after the second dose.","",""

Emerging studies have shown that disorder in autophagy results in the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles in diabetic renal cells and promotes the development of DN. Autophagy is regulated by nutrient-sensing pathways including AMPK, mTOR, and Sirt1, and several intracellular stress signaling pathways such as oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

Methods This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study that was conducted at various hospitals, using a non-probability sampling technique. The duration of the study was about six months, from January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022. The study included 590 type 2 diabetes patients, ranging in age from 35 to 70 years. Age, gender, socioeconomic status, health status, co-morbidities, and diabetes symptoms were documented. A chi-square was applied to determine the association between overall symptoms associated with type 2 diabetes and gender. An independent t-test was applied to determine the significance level between means of demographic parameters. Results The study findings showed that out of 590 patients with diabetes, 310 (52.5%) were males and 280 (47.5%) were females. The male and female mean ages were 57.46±14.93 and 50.38±14.85 years, respectively, with a statistically significant gender difference (p<0.001). The prevalence of renal manifestation in type 2 patients with diabetes revealed a significant relationship (p<0.05) for both genders.

Data came from the 2016 National Health and Wellness Survey, a nationally representative patient-reported outcomes survey conducted in the United States. Respondents with physician-diagnosed NASH, physician-diagnosed T2DM, and respondents from the general population were compared. Humanistic burden was examined with mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component summary scores from the Short-Form (SF)-36v2, concomitant diagnosis of anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties. Economic burden was analysed based on healthcare professional (HCP) and emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations in the past six months; absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work impairment, and activity impairment scores on WPAI questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariable analysis were conducted for each outcome and matched comparative group. After adjusting for baseline demographics and characteristics, NASH (N = 136) compared to the matched general population cohort (N = 544), reported significantly lower (worse) mental (MCS 43.19 vs. 46.22, p = 0.010) and physical (PCS 42.04 vs. 47.10, p < 0.001) status, higher % with anxiety (37.5% vs 25.5%, p = 0.006) and depression (43.4% vs 30.1%, p = 0.004), more HCP visits (8.43 vs. 5.17), ER visits (0.73 vs. 0.38), and hospitalizations (0.43 vs. 0.2) all p's < 0.05, and higher WPAI scores (e.g. overall work impairment 39.64% vs. 26.19%, p = 0.011).

It is driven by the data and unlike previously proposed methods does not rely on arbitrary choices of weights which can over-emphasise the contribution of some causes of death. The method is illustrated using Australian mortality data for people aged 60 years or more. Compared to the usual method based only on the underlying cause of death the new method attributes higher percentages of deaths to conditions like diabetes and dementia that are frequently mentioned as contributing causes of death, rather than underlying causes, and lower percentages to conditions to which they are closely related such as ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. For some causes, notably cancers, which are usually recorded as underlying causes with few if any contributing causes the new method produces similar percentages to the usual method. These different patterns among groups of related conditions are not apparent if arbitrary weights are used.

MetS was diagnosed by the Joint Interim Statement criteria before 13 weeks of gestational age (GA). Participants were followed up until their delivery, and the major outcomes measured were large for gestational age (LGA), small for gestational age (SGA), preterm birth (PTB) and miscarriage (MC). Gestational weight gain, gestational age at delivery and neonatal birth weight were used as measurements to define the outcomes. Additionally, outcome measures were re-assessed with adjusting fasting plasma glucose (FPG) thresholds of MetS to be compatible with hyperglycemia in pregnancy (Revised MetS). 2326 T1 pregnant women with a mean age of 28.1 years (SD-5.4), and a median GA of 8.0 weeks (IQR-2) were included. Baseline MetS prevalence was 5.9% (n = 137, 95%CI-5.0-6.9). Only 2027 (87.1%) women from baseline, had a live singleton birth, while 221(9.5%) had MC and 14(0.6%) had other pregnancy losses.

Lowered FPG thresholds were significantly associated with risk for all major pregnancy outcomes. After adjusting for sociodemographic and anthropometric confounders, revised MetS remained the only significant risk predictor for LGA. Pregnant women with T1 MetS in this population are at an increased risk for LGA and PTB and a reduced risk for SGA. We observed that a revised MetS definition with lower threshold for FPG compatible with GDM would provide a better estimation of MetS in pregnancy in relation to predicting LGA.","",""

Whole-cell patch clamp, Western blotting, superoxide dismutase activity measurement, and malondialdehyde measurement were main methods in the present study. The present study revealed that when dialysed with low calcium ion (Ca2+) solution, the SK3 current density was significantly decreased in PDGFRα+ cells from diabetic mice. However, the SK3 current density in PDGFRα+ cells was enhanced from diabetic mice when dialysed with high Ca2+ solution. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide-treatment mimicked this phenomenon in SK3 transgenic HEK293 cells. The subunit of SK3 channels, protein kinase CK2, was up-regulated in colonic muscle layers and hydrogen peroxide-treated HEK293 cells. Additionally, protein phosphatase 2A, the subunit of SK3 channels, was not changed in streptozotocin-treated mouse colons or hydrogen peroxide-treated HEK293 cells.

Therefore, it is possible that patients with T1D are at higher risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia when insulin is administered using an MDI regimen. We investigated nocturnal hypoglycemia in 50 pediatric patients with T1D on MDI insulin therapy using data from an intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) system. Hypoglycemia was observed on 446 of the 1,270 nights studied. Most of the hypoglycemic episodes were severe (blood glucose <54 mg/dL). On nights when hypoglycemia occurred, the blood glucose concentrations measured using finger-stick blood glucose monitoring (FSGM) before sleep and the next morning were lower than nights when hypoglycemia did not occur. However, few values were below the normal blood glucose range, suggesting that FSGM alone may be insufficient to detect nocturnal hypoglycemia. Approximately 7% of time was spent below the normal glucose range during the 10 hours from 21:00 to 7:00 the next morning. This result suggests that the patients on MDI insulin therapy could end up spending more time in hypoglycemia than is recommended by the American Diabetes Association (time below range <4.0% of time per day). Monitoring glucose levels overnight using an isCGM sensor may improve glycemic management via automatic detection of blood glucose peaks and troughs.","",""

A significant, positive trend in patient experience based on responses to the Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions Questionnaire was observed over the duration of programme enrolment. The MeCare programme is likely to result in substantial cost savings to the health system, while maintaining or improving patient-reported outcomes. Further research in multisite randomised studies is needed to confirm the generalisability of these results.","",""

Participants completed semistructured postintervention interviews by phone in English or French. The analytical process followed Braun and Clarke's experiential thematic analysis framework. Patient partners informed study design and interpretation. The mean age of older adults was 71.7 years, and the mean length of time living with diabetes was 18.8 years. Older adults reported positive experiences with the ACHRU-CPP that supported diabetes self-management, such as improved knowledge in managing diabetes and other chronic conditions, enhanced physical activity and function, improved eating habits, and opportunities for socialisation. They reported being connected to community resources by the intervention team to address social determinants of health and support self-management. Older adults perceived that a 6-month person-centred intervention collaboratively delivered by a team of health and social care providers helped support chronic disease self-management.

Early postoperative care consists is assessment for cortisol deficiency and diabetes insipidus (DI). Experts suggest that all patients should receive a glucocorticoid (GC) stress dose followed by rapid taper. The decision for GC replacement after discharge depends on the morning plasma cortisol level on day 3 after surgery. Experts suggest that patients with morning plasma cortisol < 10 mcg/dl should receive GC replacement at discharge, and those with 10-18 mcg/dl a morning dose only, with formal assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis at postoperative week 6. When the cortisol level is > 18 mcg/dl, the patient can be discharged safely off GC, as suggested by observational studies. Postoperative care also includes close monitoring of water balance. In DI, desmopressin is used only in case of uncomfortable polyuria or hypernatremia. Assessment of other hormones is indicated at 3 months postoperatively and beyond. Evaluation and treatment of patients following pituitary surgery are based on expert opinion and a few observational studies.

Using Global Burden of Disease data, age-standardised years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) rates per 10,000 were extracted for 150 Upper Tier Local Authority (UTLA) regions in England for every year between 1990 and 2019. The slope index of inequality was calculated using YLL rates for all causes, individual conditions, and risk factors. Joinpoint regression was used to assess the trends of any changes which arose before, during or after the NHIS. Absolute inequalities in YLL rates for all causes remained stable between 1990 and 2000, before decreasing over the following 10 years. After 2010, improvements slowed. A similar trend can be observed amongst inequalities in YLLs for individual causes, including ischaemic heart disease, stroke, breast cancer and lung cancer amongst females, and ischaemic heart disease stroke, diabetes and self-harm amongst males. This trend was also observed amongst certain risk factors, notably blood pressure, cholesterol, tobacco and dietary risks. Inequalities were generally greater in males than in females; however, trends were similar across both sexes. The NHIS coincided with significant reductions in inequalities in YLLs due to ischaemic heart disease and lung cancer. The findings suggest that the NHIS coincided with a reduction in health inequalities in England. Policy makers should consider a new cross-government strategy to tackle health inequalities drawing from the success of the previous NHIS.","",""

Pathways causing protein kinase C (PKC) activation, free radical injury, oxidative stress, and aggravating the conditions of neuropathy and nephropathy were discussed. In diabetic neuropathy and nephropathy, neurons and nephrons are affected to the extent that their normal physiology is disturbed, thus leading to further complications and conditions of loss of nerve sensation in diabetic neuropathy and kidney failure in diabetic nephropathy. Current treatment options available for the management of diabetic neuropathy are anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and topical medications, including capsaicin. According to AAN guidelines, pregabalin is recommended as the first line of therapy, whereas other drugs currently used for treatment are gabapentin, venlafaxine, opioids, amitriptyline, and valproate. Drug targets for treating diabetic neuropathy must suppress the activated polyol pathways, kinase C, hexosamine, and other pathways, which amplify neuroinflammation. Targeted therapy must focus on the reduction of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines and suppression of neuroinflammation, NF-&#954;B, AP-1, etc. Conclusion: Potential drug targets must be considered for new research on the treatment of neuropathy and nephropathy conditions.","",""

Meanwhile, combination of imaging and electronic medical record (EMR) showed superior performance than imaging or EMR alone in previous studies. One critical step is to identity predictors from high-dimensional features, and it is even more challenging to select and fuse imaging and EMR features. In this work, we develop a radiomics pipeline to assess postoperative new-onset diabetes risk of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy. Specifically, we extract multiscale image features with 3D wavelet transformation, and include patients' characteristics, body composition and pancreas volume information as clinical features. Then, we propose a multi-view subspace clustering guided feature selection method (MSCUFS) for the selection and fusion of image and clinical features. Finally, a prediction model is constructed with classical machine learning classifier. Experimental results on an established distal pancreatectomy cohort showed that the SVM model with combined imaging and EMR features demonstrated good discrimination, with an AUC value of 0.824, which improved the model with image features alone by 0.037 AUC.

This paper presents a novel deep learning (DL) model incorporating multitask learning (MTL) for personalized blood glucose prediction. The network architecture consists of shared and clustered hidden layers. Two layers of stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) form the shared hidden layers that learn generalized features from all subjects. The clustered hidden layers comprise two dense layers adapting to the gender-specific variability in the data. Finally, the subject-specific dense layers offer additional fine-tuning to personalized glucose dynamics resulting in an accurate BGC prediction at the output. OhioT1DM clinical dataset is used for the training and performance evaluation of the proposed model. A detailed analytical and clinical assessment have been performed using root mean square (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Clarke error grid analysis (EGA), respectively, which demonstrates the robustness and reliability of the proposed method. Consistently leading performance has been achieved for 30- (RMSE = 16.06 ±2.74, MAE = 10.64 ±1.35), 60- (RMSE = 30.89 ±4.31, MAE = 22.07 ±2.96), 90- (RMSE = 40.51 ±5.16, MAE = 30.16 ±4.10), and 120-minute (RMSE = 47.39 ±5.62, MAE = 36.36 ±4.54) prediction horizon (PH).

This disease is difficult to be cured and causes continued medical expenses. The early and personalized risk assessment of type 2 diabetes is necessary. So far, various type 2 diabetes risk prediction methods have been proposed. However, these methods have three major issues: 1) not fully considering the importance of personal information and rating information of healthcare system, 2) not adopting the long-term temporal information, and 3) not comprehensively capturing the correlation between the diabetes risk factor categories. To address these issues, the personalized risk assessment framework for elderly people with type 2 diabetes is needed. However, it is very challenging due to two reasons, namely imbalanced label distribution and high-dimensional features. In this paper, we propose diabetes mellitus network framework (DMNet) for type 2 diabetes risk assessment of elderly people. Specifically, we propose tandem long short-term memory to extract the long-term temporal information of different diabetes risk categories. In addition, the tandem mechanism is used to capture the correlation between the diabetes risk factor categories. To balance the label distribution, we adopt the method of synthetic minority over-sampling technique with Tomek links. To form the better feature representations, we utilize entity embedding to solve the problem of high-dimensional features. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct the experiments on a real-world dataset called Research on Early Life and Aging Trends and Effects. The experiment results show that DMNet outperforms the baseline methods in terms of six evaluation metrics (i.e., accuracy of 0.94, balanced accuracy of 0.94, precision of 0.95, F1-score of 0.95, recall of 0.95 and AUC of 0.94).","",""

However, data on the prevalence of CKD in patients with T2DM and on screening frequency are limited. SMART-Finder is the first study to exclusively use data provided directly by patients via an adherence app to collect information on the prevalence of CKD, risk factors, disease management, and quality of life of patients with T2DM in Germany. The primary objective of this study is to determine the proportion of patients with T2DM and an elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR; albumin-to-creatinine ratio stage A2 and A3) at baseline and after 12 (±3) months. Secondary objectives include the proportion of patients who remain in or switch to another albumin-to-creatinine ratio classification category after 12 months, information on quality of life, disease awareness, and adherence rates, as well as the proportion of patients without any UACR-screening data. Recruitment occurs via push notification among MyTherapy app users with T2DM. This is a single-arm, retrospective/prospective, observational, digital, patient-centered cohort study, with recruitment and data documentation via a health app. Required routine laboratory data are provided by treating physicians to their patients for data entry. The study population includes adult patients with T2DM documenting their data in the MyTherapy app using their own smartphone or tablet. Study participants are provided with a specifically developed electronic case report form containing questions on demographic and general data, quality of life, disease awareness, and laboratory values including estimated glomerular filtration rate, UACR, hemoglobin 1Ac, and blood pressure. Apart from demographic and general data, all data are collected at baseline and 12 months after the last UACR assessment. An automatically generated push notification reminds participants of the second data entry. The extracted and pseudonymized data are analyzed descriptively. The enrollment period for this study started in February 2023 and shall end after 12 months or after the enrollment of 5000 patients. An interim analysis is planned 3 months after the inclusion of the first patient and the final analysis after 12 months of follow-up. Overall, the study will contribute to minimizing the existing data gap on the prevalence of CKD in patients with T2DM in Germany, provide important insights into the current disease management of patients with T2DM in everyday clinical practice in Germany, and support guideline-based care for the participating patients.

The present study used a psoriasislike inflammatory cell model and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mouse model to confirm whether chemerin is upregulated in psoriasis patients. Chemerin enhanced the keratinocyte proliferation, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Crucially, the intraperitoneal injection of neutralizing anti-chemerin antibody (ChAb) diminished the epidermal proliferation and inflammation in the IMQ-induced mouse model. The present results indicate that chemerin promotes keratinocyte proliferation, and enhances the production of inflammatory cytokines, thereby aggravating the psoriasis.

Studies were included if they conducted a systematic review and/or meta-analysis on flow-mediated dilation responses to exercise interventions in adults. Sources were searched in January 2022 and included Scopus, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Academic Search Premier. National Institutes of Health quality assessment tools were used. The results were presented narratively. Twenty-seven systematic reviews, including 19 meta-analyses, (total: 5464 unique participants, 2181 reported unique female individuals) met the inclusion criteria. The average overall quality of included reviews was 8.8/11. The quality of studies within each included review varied from low to moderate using a variety of quality assessment scales. Reviews were conducted in healthy adults (n = 9, meta-analyses = 6), as well as those with type 2 diabetes (n = 5, meta-analyses = 4), cardiovascular conditions [i.e., conditions that impact the cardiovascular system, but excluding samples of only type 2 diabetes] (n = 11, meta-analyses = 7), and other chronic conditions (n = 2, meta-analyses = 2). Overall, the included reviews provided evidence that the type of training to optimally improve FMD may vary based on disease condition. Specifically, the evidence suggests that healthy adults benefitted most from higher intensity aerobic training and/or more frequent low-to-moderate resistance training. In addition, adults with type 2 diabetes benefitted most from low-intensity resistance or aerobic exercise training, whereas those with cardiovascular conditions should consider engaging in high-intensity aerobic training to improve endothelial function. This information may help guide the design of specific exercise programs or recommendations for adults with chronic conditions.","",""

These effects of LA position dietary LA-rich oils as a potential dietary strategy to aid in preventing CMD. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear hormone receptors that are cellular targets for many polyunsaturated fatty acids and oxylipin metabolites. PPAR activation can regulate dyslipidemia, insulin sensitivity, adipose biology, and inflammation, potentially explaining the plethora of effects of dietary LA on aspects of CMD.

Logistic regression models of the dependency of outcomes on exposures and covariates were constructed using a multi-step process. Influential covariates were identified first using placebo arm data, followed by assessment of exposure-dependency in drug effect using data from both the placebo and MOV arms. The exposure-response (E-R) analysis included 1,313 participants; 630 received MOV and 683 received placebo. Baseline viral load, baseline disease severity, age, weight, viral clade, active cancer, and diabetes were identified as significant determinants of response using placebo data. Absolute measures of viral load on days 5 and 10 were strong on-treatment predictors of hospitalization. An additive area under the curve (AUC)-based Emax model with a fixed Hill coefficient of 1 best represented the exposure-dependency in drug effect and the AUC50 was estimated to be 19,900 nM*hr. Patients at 800 mg achieved near maximal response which was larger than for 200 or 400 mg. The final E-R model was externally validated and predicted that the relative reduction in hospitalization with MOV treatment would vary with patient characteristics and factors in the population.

However, the pathogenesis of DKD remains unclear, and effective treatment strategies are still lacking. Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) has been reported to improve DKD, but the mechanism is unclear. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is an essential reactive oxygen species (ROS) source in the kidney. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling may exacerbate renal fibrosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that Rg1 might alleviate renal injury and fibrosis by inhibiting NOX4 and MAPK signaling in T2DM-induced DKD. We found that Rg1 significantly improves lipid deposition, fibrosis, and ROS production and reduces NOX4, p22phox, p47phox, p-ERK, p-JNK, and p-P38 MAPK expressions in the T2DM mice kidneys. We also found that the high-fat diet treatment in mice and the palmitate (PA) and PA + HG (high glucose) exposure in human mesangial cells could significantly induce lipid deposition, ROS production, fibrosis, and the activation of NOX4-MAPK signaling. The results suggest that high lipid and glucose may play a significant role in DKD progression, while Rg1 may attenuate renal fibrosis by inhibiting NOX4-MAPK signaling.","",""

Objective To assess the demographics and level of awareness among individuals with diabetes about diabetic retinopathy during their visit to Department of Ophthalmology at Dhulikhel Hospital. Method A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted involving all consecutive cases of diabetes mellitus who attended eye clinic with the principal investigator and co-investigator from March 2021 to August 2021. Detailed demographics of the participants, their level of awareness regarding diabetic retinopathy and associated complications were documented. This was followed by a detailed ocular examination intending to screen for the presence of features of diabetic retinopathy. Result A total of 260 patients with a mean age of 54 years ± 12.20 (range of 24 - 85 years) were included. The male to female ratio was 2.2:1. Among them, 65.4% of the patients had diabetes mellitus for less than 5 years duration. Diabetic retinopathy was found in 18.46% of the cases. Awareness of diabetic ocular complications was significantly higher among literate population (p = 0.054), among those who have positive family history of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.529) and those who had undergone prior fundus evaluation (p = 0.000).

Accordingly, a large proportion of high-risk patients with early-stage CKD remain unidentified, missing the opportunity to receive optimized treatment with novel agents that are effective in causing regression of albuminuria and in improving adverse cardiorenal outcomes. The broader implementation of albuminuria assessment in daily clinical practice facilitates the identification of high-risk patients with early-stage CKD who are candidates for treatment with sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone.

Improper Na+ balance, hypernatremia, and a mild but significant increase in BP were found in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice in response to HS intake for 7 days. Compared to the vehicle, STZ mice showed increased Kir4.1 expression and activity in the DCT, a more negative membrane potential, higher NCC abundance, and enhanced hydrochlorothiazide-induced natriuretic effect. However, HS had no significant effect on basolateral Kir4.1 expression/activity and DCT membrane potential, or NCC activity under diabetic conditions, despite a downregulation in phosphorylated NCC abundance. In contrast, HS significantly downregulated the expression of Na+-H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) and cleaved epithelial sodium channel-γ in STZ mice, despite an increase in NHE3 abundance after STZ treatment. Kir4.1 deletion largely abolished STZ-induced upregulation of NCC expression and prevented BP elevation during HS intake. Interestingly, HS causes severe hypokalemia in STZ-treated kidney-specific Kir4.1 knockout (Ks-Kir4.1 KO) mice and lead to death within a few days, which could be attributed to a higher circulating aldosterone level.

Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L) is widely recognized for its antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, hepatoprotective, and anticancer activities. The current study evaluated rosemary essential oil (REO) effects on biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical kidney alterations in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and compared these effects with those of insulin and both combined. Methods We randomly distributed 36 adult albino rats into 6 groups: normal control (non-diabetic), diabetic (streptozotocin, 55 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), diabetic insulin-treated (Lantus insulin 2 units/day, SC), diabetic REO-treated (REO, 10 ml, nasogastric gavage), and diabetic insulin & REO-treated groups. Biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical analyses were conducted. Results The diabetic group revealed a substantial increase in blood glucose, urea, creatinine, and uric acid, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) and catalase (CAT) concentrations in kidney homogenates, high score of tubular injury, and increased glomerulosclerosis, along with marked reduction of total glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) when compared to control. Evident improvement was detected in rats treated with REO as it demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, pro-proliferative, and mild anti-hyperglycemic effects on diabetic rats, reducing the kidney damage caused by diabetes. Combined insulin and REO restored normal blood glucose, renal excretory function tests, antioxidant markers, and renal cortex histology. Conclusion The data presented in the current study's in vivo animal model suggests that REO supplementation has beneficial nephroprotective effects on the structural and, to a lesser extent, functional levels of diabetic rats. Furthermore, the detected nephroprotective effects of insulin and REO combined are superior to those of either administered alone. However, further studies are needed to evaluate these conclusions in humans further.","",""

Oxidative stress results in damage of several cellular structures (lipids, proteins, lipoproteins, and DNA) and is implicated in various disease states such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, cancer, neurodegeneration, and aging. A large body of studies showed that ROS plays an important role in carcinogenesis. Indeed, increased production of ROS causes accumulation in DNA damage leading to tumorigenesis. Various investigations demonstrated the involvement of ROS in gliomagenesis. The most common type of primary intracranial tumor in adults is represented by glioma. Furthermore, there is growing attention on the role of the Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) in brain tumor pathogenesis. NGF is a growth factor belonging to the family of neurotrophins. It is involved in neuronal differentiation, proliferation and survival. Studies were conducted to investigate NGF pathogenesis's role as a pro- or anti-tumoral factor in brain tumors. It has been observed that NGF can induce both differentiation and proliferation in cells. The involvement of NGF in the pathogenesis of brain tumors leads to the hypothesis of a possible implication of NGF in new therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have focused on the role of neurotrophin receptors as potential targets in glioma therapy. This review provides an updated overview of the role of ROS and NGF in gliomagenesis and their emerging role in glioma treatment.","",""

Both Chinese and English literature of qualitative research on self-management experiences and perceptions of prediabetic patients were included. The quality of the included studies was evaluated, and the data were synthesised and analysed by thematic synthesis method. A total of 23 primary studies containing 504 participants were included. After repeated reading and coding of the literature, three analytical themes were finally identified: coping with role management, success and failure in medical management, seeking and perceiving support. Role management for people with prediabetes needs more attention. Healthcare providers should identify problems from patients' self-management experiences and improve professional skills to assist program modifications. Integrating the self-management program into community activities under the guidance of medical staff and inviting family members and peers to participate can increase involvement and improve the self-management ability. These findings describe the different stages and issues in the self-management process of prediabetic patients.

This cohort study used data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, a representative national healthcare database in Korea. We established a cohort of 348,180 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 without a history of diabetes between January 2020 and September 2021. The control group consisted of sex- and age-matched individuals with neither a history of diabetes nor COVID-19. We assessed the hazard ratios (HR) of newly diagnosed T2DM patients with COVID-19 compared to controls, adjusted for age, sex, and the presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia. In the post-acute phase, patients with COVID-19 had an increased risk of newly diagnosed T2DM compared to those without COVID-19 (adjusted HR, 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27 to 1.33).

Persistent socioeconomic health care barriers exacerbate this situation, as T2D morbidity and mortality are worsened in vulnerable populations, such as those without social security. We evaluated the performance of public primary health centers (PHCs) in T2D medical attention through the measure of effective coverage (EC, a combined measure of health care need, use, and quality) at national, state, health jurisdiction, and municipality levels. This retrospective analysis used blinded data recorded during 2017 in the Non-communicable Diseases National Information System (SIC) and T2D prevalence reported in 2018 ENSANUT to evaluate the EC achieved. We included individuals ≥ 20 years old without social security who did not declare the use of private health care services. Each EC component (need, use, and quality) was estimated based on the Shengelia adapted framework. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to evaluate the associations among EC quintiles and demographics. In 2017, 26.5 million individuals, aged ≥ 20 years, without social security, and without the use of private health care services, were under the care of 12,086 PHCs. The national prevalence of T2D was 10.3%, equivalent to 2.6 million people living with T2D in need of primary health care. Large contrasts were seen among EC components between and within Mexican states. We found that only 37.1% of the above individuals received health services at PHCs and of them, 25.8% improved their metabolic condition. The national EC was 9.3%, and the range (by health jurisdiction) was 0.2%-38.6%, representing a large geographic disparity in EC. We found an evident disconnect among need, utilization, and quality rates across the country. Expansion and improvement of EC are urgently needed to address the growing number of people living with T2D in Mexico, particularly in states with vulnerable populations.","",""

Grip strength (kg) was measured at 53, 60-64 and 69 years. Pre-/diabetes was defined at 53 years based on HbA1c > 5.6% and/or doctor-diagnosis of diabetes. Sex-specific latent class trajectory models were developed and multinomial logistic regression was used to investigate the association between pre-/diabetes status and membership into GS trajectory classes. For both males and females, a 3-class solution ('High', 'Intermediate', 'Low') provided the best representation of the GS data and the most plausible solution. There was no evidence that pre-/diabetes status was associated with class membership in either sex: e.g., adjusted odds ratios of being in the 'Low' class (vs. 'High') for males with pre-/diabetes (vs. no-diabetes) was 1.07 (95% CI:0.45,2.55). Using a flexible data-driven approach to identify GS trajectories between 53 and 69 years, we observed three distinct GS trajectories, all declining, in both sexes.

Deviation is detected by a variety of sensors that react to alarm signals arising from injury, infection and other inflammatory triggers. One important element of this alarm system is the innate immune system, which recognizes pathogen-/microbe- or damage-associated molecular patterns via pattern recognition receptors localized in the cytosol or in membranes of innate immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells and mast cells but also of T-cells, B-cells and epithelial cells. Activation of the innate immune system results in inflammation and is a pre-requisite for activation of the adaptive immune system. Another important element is represented by the unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress response of the endoplasmic reticulum. The UPR regulates proteostasis, and also contributes to the course of inflammatory diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity and neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the UPR is instrumental in allergic contact dermatitis. This inflammatory skin disease, affecting 5-10% of the population, is caused by T-cells recognizing low-molecular weight organic chemicals and metal ions.

Multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors of serious complications and 30-day mortality. There was a total of 751,607 patients, 5.3% (n = 39,854) were elderly. Mean ages were 43 ± 11 years (non-elderly) versus 68 ± 3 years (elderly). Elderly patients were less likely to be female (70.7% elderly; 80.1% non-elderly) and had lower BMI (43.17 ± 6.64 kg/m2 elderly; 45.42 ± 7.87 kg/m2 non-elderly). They had higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, lower functional status, more insulin dependent diabetes, and hypertension, among other comorbidities. There were no clinically significant differences between the most frequently performed bariatric surgery. Sleeve gastrectomy remained the most common (73.7% non-elderly; 72.3% elderly); however, operative time was longer among the elderly. Functional status was most predictive for both serious complications (OR 1.72; CI 1.53-1.94) and mortality (OR 2.92; CI 1.98-4.31).

Recurrent hypoglycaemia in rodent models of chemically induced (streptozotocin [STZ]) diabetes leads to cognitive impairment in memory-related tasks associated with hippocampal oxidative damage. This study examined the hypothesis that post-hypoglycaemic hyperglycaemia in STZ-diabetes exacerbates hippocampal oxidative stress and explored potential contributory mechanisms. The hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp technique was used to induce equivalent hypoglycaemia and to control post-hypoglycaemic glucose levels in mice with and without STZ-diabetes and Nrf2-/- mice (lacking Nrf2 [also known as Nfe2l2]). Subsequently, quantitative proteomics based on stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture and biochemical approaches were used to assess oxidative damage and explore contributory pathways. Evidence of hippocampal oxidative damage was most marked in mice with STZ-diabetes exposed to post-hypoglycaemic hyperglycaemia; these mice also showed induction of Nrf2 and the Nrf2 transcriptional targets Sod2 and Hmox-1. In this group, hypoglycaemia induced a significant upregulation of proteins involved in alternative fuel provision, reductive biosynthesis and degradation of damaged proteins, and a significant downregulation of proteins mediating the stress response. Key differences emerged between mice with and without STZ-diabetes following recovery from hypoglycaemia in proteins mediating the stress response and reductive biosynthesis. There is a disruption of the cellular response to a hypoglycaemic challenge in mice with STZ-induced diabetes that is not seen in wild-type non-diabetic animals. The chronic hyperglycaemia of diabetes and post-hypoglycaemic hyperglycaemia act synergistically to induce oxidative stress and damage in the hippocampus, possibly leading to irreversible damage/modification to proteins or synapses between cells. In conclusion, recurrent hypoglycaemia in sub-optimally controlled diabetes may contribute, at least in part, to accelerated cognitive decline through amplifying oxidative damage in key brain regions, such as the hippocampus.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensing kinase and its activation has been suggested as a treatment option for metabolic diseases. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of MST1 and activation of AMPK simultaneously represents a promising approach for diabetes therapy. Here, we discovered a novel selective MST1 kinase inhibitor IHMT-MST1-39, which exhibits anti-apoptosis efficacy and improves the survival of pancreatic β cells under diabetogenic conditions, as well as primary pancreatic islets in an ex vivo disease model.

Five broad categories of built environment characteristics were associated with T2D in Asia. These included urban green space, walkability, food environment, availability and accessibility of services such as recreational and healthcare facilities and air pollution. We found very strong evidence of a positive association of particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide (p<0.001) with T2D risk. Several built environment attributes were significantly related to T2D in Asia. When compared with Western countries, very few studies have been conducted in Asia.

However, the low-quality fundus images increase the uncertainty of clinical diagnosis, resulting in a significant decrease on the grading performance of the fundus images. Therefore, enhancing the image quality is essential for predicting the grade level in DR diagnosis. In essence, we are faced with three challenges: (I) How to appropriately evaluate the quality of fundus images; (II) How to effectively enhance low-quality fundus images for providing reliable fundus images to ophthalmologists or automated analysis systems; (III) How to jointly train the quality assessment and enhancement for improving the DR grading performance. Considering the importance of image quality assessment and enhancement for DR grading, we propose a collaborative learning framework to jointly train the subnetworks of the image quality assessment as well as enhancement, and DR disease grading in a unified framework. The key contribution of the proposed framework lies in modelling the potential correlation of these tasks and the joint training of these subnetworks, which significantly improves the fundus image quality and DR grading performance. Our framework is a general learning model, which may be useful in other medical images with low-quality data. Extensive experimental results have shown that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DR grading methods by a considerable 73.6% ACC/71.2% Kappa and 88.5% ACC/86.3% Kappa on Messidor and EyeQ benchmark datasets, respectively. In addition, our method significantly enhances the low-quality fundus images while preserving fundus structure features and lesion information.

In addition, combined GIPR/GLP1R agonism markedly lowered plasma triglyceride (TG) levels as explained by reduced hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG production as well as increased TG-derived fatty acid uptake by brown and white adipose tissue which was coupled to enhanced hepatic uptake of core VLDL remnants. Combined GIPR/GLP1R agonism attenuates atherosclerosis severity by diminishing inflammation and increasing VLDL turnover. We anticipate that combined GIPR/GLP1R agonism is a promising strategy to lower cardiometabolic risk in humans.","",""

Data on all incident ESRD cases aged ≥20 years receiving chronic RRT between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2018 (N = 7883) were collected from Israel's National Dialysis & Renal Transplant Register. Individual-level data on ESRD cases requiring RRT included residential area, age, gender, ethnicity (Jewish or Arab) and ESRD cause (diabetes, other, unknown/missing). Area-level data included age and sex distribution, socio-economic status (SES) and proportion of Arab population. The associations between individual-level socio-demographic characteristics and ESRD cause were tested in bivariate comparisons. The risk of developing ESRD during the study period (from all and specific causes) was estimated using multiple Poisson regression models with negative binomial distribution, using four parameters, namely sex, ethnicity, SES category and age strata, based on area-level distribution of these parameters, and with the whole population (aged ≥20 years) as the denominator. A socio-economic gradient was seen for ESRD from all causes, more marked for diabetic aetiology [rate ratio (RR)=0.45, 95% CI: 0.39-0.52 highest vs lowest SES categories] than from other (RR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.55-0.75) or unknown cause (RR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0. 62-0.99). Based on population area-level data, predominantly Arab neighbourhoods showed higher risk for ESRD requiring RRT for all causes, with the strongest association for diabetes (RR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.53-1.86) adjusted for SES, age and sex. A strong socio-economic gradient was demonstrated for ESRD requiring RRT. Arab ethnicity was associated with higher risk for ESRD, especially due to diabetes.

Five tax scenarios were modelled, representing three levels of price increase: 5%, 11% and 19-20%. Scenarios of the highest price increase were assessed across three different tax designs: ad valorem, volume-based specific tax & sugar-based specific tax. We modelled SSBs consumption in each tax scenario; how this reduction in consumption translates to a reduction in total energy intake and how this relationship in turn translates to an average change in body weight and obesity status among adults by applying the calorie-to weight conversion factor. Changes in type 2 diabetes burden were then calculated based on the change in average BMI of the modelled cohort. A Monte Carlo simulation approach was applied on the conversion factor of weight change and diabetes risk reduction for the sensitivity analysis. We found that the taxation that involved a 5% price increase gave relatively small impacts while increasing SSBs' price up to 20% appeared to impact substantially on overweight and obesity rates (reduction of 12.7% and 12.4% respectively) saving 27 million USD for direct medical cost. The greatest reduction was observed for overweight and obesity class I. The decline in overweight and obesity rates was slightly higher for women than men. This study supports the SSB tax policy in pursuit of public health benefits, especially where the tax increase involves around a 20% price increase. The health benefit and revenue gains were evident across all three tax designs with the specific tax based on sugar density achieving greatest effects.","",""

Here, we used a mouse model of maternal LCS consumption to explore the impact of perinatal LCS exposure on the development of neural systems involved in metabolic regulations. We report that adult male, but not female, offspring from both aspartame- and rebaudioside A-exposed dams displayed increased adiposity and developed glucose intolerance. Moreover, maternal LCS consumption reorganized hypothalamic melanocortin circuits and disrupted parasympathetic innervation of pancreatic islets in male offspring. We then identified phenylacetylglycine (PAG) as a unique metabolite that is upregulated in the milk of LCS-fed dams and the serum of their pups. Furthermore, maternal PAG treatment recapitulates some of the key metabolic and neurodevelopmental abnormalities associated with maternal LCS consumption. Together, our data indicate that maternal LCS consumption has enduring consequences on the offspring's metabolism and neural development and that these effects are likely to be mediated through the gut microbial co-metabolite PAG.","",""

Upon the intestinal barrier disruption, components from bacterial metabolism and bacteria itself can reach peripheral tissues through circulation. This has been associated with the low-grade inflammation that characterizes obesity and other metabolic diseases. While circulating bacterial DNA has been postulated as a common feature of obesity and even type 2 diabetes, almost no focus has been given to the existence and effects of bacteria in peripheral tissues, namely the adipose tissue. As a symbiont population, it is expected that gut microbiota modulate the immunometabolism of the host, thus influencing energy balance mechanisms and inflammation. Gut inflammatory signals cause direct deleterious inflammatory responses in adipose tissue and may also affect key gut neuroendocrine mechanisms governing nutrient sensing and energy balance, like incretins and ghrelin, which play a role in the gut-brain-adipose tissue axis. Thus, it is of major importance to disclose how gut microbiota and derived signals modulate neuroendocrine and inflammatory pathways, which contribute to the dysfunction of adipose tissue and to the metabolic sequelae of obesity and related disorders. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding these topics and identifies new perspectives in this field of research, highlighting new pathways toward the reduction of the inflammatory burden of metabolic diseases.","",""

Previous studies have examined glycaemic responses to different exercise modalities but paid little attention to participants' prandial state, although this is an important consideration and will enhance our understanding of the effects of exercise in order to improve blood glucose management around activity. This review summarises available data on the glycaemic effects of postprandial exercise (i.e. exercise within 2 h after a meal) in people with type 1 diabetes. Using a search strategy on electronic databases, literature was screened until November 2022 to identify clinical trials evaluating acute (during exercise), subacute (≤2 h after exercise) and late (>2 h to ≤24 h after exercise) effects of postprandial exercise in adults with type 1 diabetes. Studies were systematically organised and assessed by exercise modality: (1) walking exercise (WALK); (2) continuous exercise of moderate intensity (CONT MOD); (3) continuous exercise of high intensity (CONT HIGH); and (4) interval training (intermittent high-intensity exercise [IHE] or high-intensity interval training [HIIT]). Primary outcomes were blood glucose change and hypoglycaemia occurrence during and after exercise. All study details and results per outcome were listed in an evidence table. Twenty eligible articles were included: two included WALK sessions, eight included CONT MOD, seven included CONT HIGH, three included IHE and two included HIIT. All exercise modalities caused consistent acute glycaemic declines, with the largest effect size for CONT HIGH and the smallest for HIIT, depending on the duration and intensity of the exercise bout. Pre-exercise mealtime insulin reductions created higher starting blood glucose levels, thereby protecting against hypoglycaemia, in spite of similar declines in blood glucose during activity between the different insulin reduction strategies. Nocturnal hypoglycaemia occurred after higher intensity postprandial exercise, a risk that could be diminished by a post-exercise snack with concomitant bolus insulin reduction. Research on the optimal timing of postprandial exercise is inconclusive. In summary, individuals with type 1 diabetes exercising postprandially should substantially reduce insulin with the pre-exercise meal to avoid exercise-induced hypoglycaemia, with the magnitude of the reduction depending on the exercise duration and intensity. Importantly, pre-exercise blood glucose and timing of exercise should be considered to avoid hyperglycaemia around exercise. To protect against late-onset hypoglycaemia, a post-exercise meal with insulin adjustments might be advisable, especially for exercise in the evening or with a high-intensity component.","",""

T2DM can promote the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in exocrine ducts, including in the human pancreas. We hypothesize that ACE2 expression levels are associated with increased numbers of lymphocytes in vivo.

Thus 3 foot creams formulated with a neutral, acidic or alkaline pH were compared to each other as well as to an untreated control group in order to analyse their impact on skin pH, hydration and general skin condition. An exploratory clinical investigation with 60 enrolled subjects, half of whom had a diagnosis of diabetes (type 1 or type 2), was undertaken. The investigation followed a randomized, double blind, balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) including intra-individual comparison (before and after treatment). Evaluations of skin pH and hydration were carried out using a pH-meter and a Corneometer respectively. Objective evaluation of skin condition for efficacy assessment was performed by a trained grader. For tolerability evaluation, objective and subjective dermatological assessments were performed. At the end of the treatment period the skin pH was largely unchanged at 5 out of 6 of the test areas, with the mean value for each treatment group using test products showing similar fluctuations as the untreated control group. Furthermore, the skin condition parameters studied all improved by a comparable magnitude for each of the treatment groups using the test products, whereas the untreated control group experienced a worsening of the skin condition parameters. The results of this investigation suggest that where the skin of the foot is concerned, the pH of skin care formulations has no (physiologically) relevant influence on the skin's pH in either diabetic or non-diabetic subjects.

It was a cross-sectional study with 93 healthy male subjects and 112 type 2 diabetic male patients who underwent body composition analysis by BIA and fasting venous blood samples were collected. US-CRP and body composition were determined for all subjects. US-CRP is correlated positively with AC (0.378) and BMI (0.394) more than AMC (0.282) and WHR (0.253) which have lower correlation both in control and DM group. BCM has the lowest correlation with US-CRP (0.105). The association between US-CRP and AC, AMC, Body Fat Percent (BFP), and body fat mass (BFM) are statistically significant except for BFP in DM group. In control group, AC is noticed to be a better predictor for US-CRP, with area under curve (AUC) 64.2% (p=0.019), WHR with AUC 72.6% (p<0.001), and BMI with AUC 65.4% (p=0.011) but AMC is not a good predictor in control group with AUC 57.5% (p=0.213).

The aim of the present research is to establish whether MCT oil has a therapeutic influence on the hepatic damage occurring in male albino rats as a result of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. 24 male albino rats were randomized into four cohorts, i.e., controls, STZ-diabetic, metformin-treated and MCT oil-treated. The rodents were fed a high-fat diet for 14 days; a low dose of intraperitoneal STZ was then administered in order to induce diabetes. The rats were subsequently treated for 4 weeks with metformin or MCT oil. Analysis included an appraisal of liver histology and biochemical indices, i.e., fasting blood glucose (FBG), hepatic enzymes and glutathione (GSH), the latter obtained from hepatic tissue homogenate. A rise in FBG and hepatic enzymes was observed, but in the STZ-diabetic cohort, hepatic GSH levels were diminished. Treatment with either metformin or MCT oil led to a decline in FBG and hepatic enzyme titers whereas GSH concentrations increased. Liver histology findings were notable amongst rodents within control, STZ-diabetic and metformin-treated groups. The majority of histological changes were resolved following therapy with MCT oil. The anti-diabetic and antioxidant characteristics of MCT oil have been substantiated by this work. MCT oil led to a reversal of the hepatic histological changes seen in STZ-induced diabetes in rats.","",""

Wistar male rats were divided into five groups; normal diet (ND) and HFD, in which rats were fed with a normal diet or HFD for 10 weeks, respectively. In HFD + sage group, animals were administered sage essential oil (0.052 ml/kg) orally along with HFD. In HFD + TQ group, rats were administered TQ (50 mg/kg) orally with HFD. In HF + sage + TQ group, animals received sage + TQ along with HFD. Blood glucose (BGL) and Fast serum insulin (FSI) levels, oral glucose tolerance test, blood pressure, liver function tests, plasma, and hepatic oxidative stress markers, antioxidant enzymes, and glutathione content, and lipid profile were measured. Sage and TQ combination decreased the final body weight, weight gain, BGL, FSI, and Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

Intensive glucose control is believed to hinder the pathological progression of these complications. In this review, we focus on the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) under intensive treatment with recently introduced glucose-lowering drugs, including glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. GLP-1RAs are more suitable for patients with diabetes at risk for, or established, cardiovascular complications, while SGLT2 inhibitors are more appropriate for complications of heart failure and chronic renal diseases. Accumulating evidence indicates that GLP-1RAs may provide a greater reduction in the risk of DR in patients with diabetes compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, sulfonylureas, or insulin. GLP-1RAs may be ideal antihyperglycemic drugs with direct benefits for the retina, since GLP-1R can be expressed in photoreceptors. Topical administration of GLP-1RAs induces direct retinal neuroprotection against DR by multiple mechanisms, such as preventing both neurodysfunction and retinal neurodegeneration; relieving the disruption of the blood-retinal barrier and associated vascular leakage, and inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammatory action, and neuronal apoptosis. Hence, it seems reasonable to utilize this strategy to treat patients with diabetes and early-stage DR, rather than exclusively using neuroprotective agents.","",""

Univariate and multivariate analysis showed moyamoya vessel on the surgical hemisphere (OR = 3.04, 95% CI = 1.02-9.03, P = 0.046) and left operated hemisphere (OR = 5.16, 95% CI = 1.09-21.34, P = 0.041) were independent risk factors for CHS. The other variables, such as age, gender, presentation, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, mean mRS score on admission, modified Suzuki stage and pre-infarction stage on surgical hemisphere, and bypass patency, had no association with postoperative CHS (P > 0.05). At final follow-up with average 38 months, there were 18 out of 133 patients (13.5%, 4.91% per person year) presented with newly developed complications. There was no significant difference between newly developed complications, mean mRS scores, and Kaplan-Meier curve of stroke-free survival in patients with and without CHS (P > 0.05). The concentration of moyamoya vessels and left operated hemisphere was independent risk factors for CHS, which could not affect the clinical prognosis if treated timely and properly. The current study offers a new perspective of moyamoya vessels and supporting data for choosing MMD candidates on cerebral revascularization.","",""

Maternal cardiometabolic markers included diabetes, obesity, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, hypertension, and fasting glucose during pregnancy. Cord blood markers of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, and adiponectin were used as child mediators. Child outcomes included two starting school variables: British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS) and the Letter Identification Assessment (LID), and five developmental milestone domains from a national UK framework: (1) communication and language (COM); (2) personal, social, and emotional (PSE); (3) physical development (PHY); (4) literacy (LIT); and (5) mathematics (MAT). Mediation models were used to examine the associations between the classification of maternal metabolic syndrome and child developmental milestones. Models were adjusted for potential maternal, socioeconomic, and child confounders such as maternal education, deprivation, and gestational age. In mediation models, significant total effects were found for MetS associations with children's development in the LIT domain at age 5. MetS predicted individual cord blood mediators of lower HDL and increased leptin levels in both adjusted and unadjusted models. Total indirect effects (effects of all mediators combined) for MetS on a child's COM and PSE domain were significant, through all child cord blood mediators of LDL, HDL, triglycerides, adiponectin, and leptin for adjusted models. The results support the hypothesis that maternal metabolic syndrome classification during pregnancy is associated with some child developmental outcomes at age 5. After adjusting for maternal, child, and environmental covariates, maternal metabolic syndrome classification during pregnancy was associated with children's LIT domain through direct effects of maternal metabolic health and indirect effects of cord blood markers (total effects), and COM and PSE domains via changes only in a child's cord blood markers (total indirect effects).","",""

Its prenatal toxicity study is minimal. Thus, this study aimed to assess the toxic effects of a 70% ethanol extract of Moringa stenopetala leaf on the fetuses and placentas of pregnant Wistar rats. Fresh leaves of Moringa stenopetala were collected, dried at room temperature, ground to powder, and extracted using 70% ethanol. For this study, five groups of animals, each containing ten pregnant rats, were used. Groups I-III were experimental groups and treated with 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg body weight of Moringa stenopetala leaf extract, respectively. Groups IV and V were pair-fed and ad libitum control groups. The extract was given during gestation days 6 to 12. The fetuses were recovered at day 20 of gestation and examined for the presence of developmental delays, gross external malformations, skeletal and visceral defects. Gross and histopathological changes in the placenta were also evaluated. Compared to the pair-fed control group, maternal daily food intake and weight gain were reduced in the 1000 mg/kg-treated group during the treatment and post-treatment periods. A significantly higher number of fetal resorptions was also seen in the 1000 mg/kg treatment group. The crown-rump length and fetal and placental weights were all significantly reduced in pregnant rats given 1000 mg/kg. However, there were no visible malformations in the visceral organs as well as external genitalia in all the treatment and control groups. About 40.7% of the fetuses in the 1000 mg/kg treated rats had no proximal hindlimb phalanges. In addition, light microscopic investigations of the placenta in the high-dose treated rats revealed structural changes in the decidual basalis, trophoblastic zone, and labyrinthine zones. In conclusion, consumption of M. stenopetala leaves at a higher dose may have toxic effects on the development of rat fetuses. At a higher dose, the plant extract increased the number of fetal resorptions, reduced the number of fetuses, decreased the fetal and placental weights, and alter the placental histopathology. Thus, it is recommended to limit the excess feeding of M. stenopetala leaves during gestation.","",""

This study aimed to develop an internet-based modern Health Promotion model using interactive online applications through continuing education and participation. The goal was to positively impact knowledge, behavior, and quality of life for patients with obesity and/or diabetes. This is a prospective interventional study on patients with obesity or type 2 diabetes. Seventeen two patients who met the inclusion criteria were distributed randomly into two groups (control and intervention) from 2019 to 2021 in Greece. All the participants were given questionaries concerning quality of life anxiety and depression (HADS) attitudes and beliefs, knowledge about their condition and general questions to establish a baseline. A traditional health promotion model was followed for the control group. For participants in the intervention group, a web-based health promotion program was created according to the goals of the research. Participants were instructed to log on 1-2 times a week for 5-15 min, with the understanding that the research team would be monitoring their activities. The website included two knowledge games and personalized educational material based on their needs. The sample comprised 72 patients (36 in control and 36 in the intervention groups). The mean age was 47.8 years for the control group and 42.7 years for the intervention group (p = 0.293). Both study groups had a significant increase in knowledge score on diabetes (Control group:3,24, Intervention group 11,88 p < 0,001) and obesity (Control group:4,9, Intervention group 51,63 p < 0,001) along with a positive attitude score towards fighting obesity (Control group: 1,8, Intervention group 13,6 p < 0,001). Still, the overall change was more remarkable for the intervention group, as indicated by the significant interaction effect of the analysis. Anxiety was decreased only in the intervention group (Control group:0,11, Intervention group - 0,17 p < 0,005).

Furthermore, Social relationships were improved only in the intervention group (Control group 0,02, Intervention group 0,56 p < 0,001). The results of the present study showed that the participants in the intervention group showed significant improvement in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs after using the internet as a learning tool. The intervention group also showed significantly reduced anxiety and depression arising from chronic illness. All of this resulted in an improved quality of life regarding physical Health, mental Health, and social relationships.

The alterations in cardiac autonomic parameters in diabetic animals were assessed by heart rate variability, hemodynamic parameters, and baroreflex sensitivity. TRPC5's role in DCAN was investigated by treating diseased rats with BTD (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.p. for 14 days). BTD's beneficial effects in parasympathetic dysfunction were assessed by western blotting, estimating oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in the vagus nerve. BTD treatment (3 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 14 days ameliorated heart rate variability, hemodynamic dysfunction, and baroreflex sensitivity diseased rats. BTD treatment down regulated TRPC5 expression by increasing the activity of protein kinase C in the vagus nerve. It also down-regulated the apoptotic marker CASPASE-3 and also exerted potent anti-inflammatory action on pro-inflammatory cytokines levels in the vagus.

By using omics approaches, upregulation of ApoJ was found in high-fat medium-fed hepatocytes and livers of patients with NAFLD. Hepatic ApoJ level associated with the levels of mTOR and protein markers of autophagy and correlated positively with lipid contents in the liver of mice. Functionally, nonsecreted intracellular ApoJ bound to mTOR kinase domain and prevented mTOR ubiquitination by interfering FBW7 ubiquitin ligase interaction through its R324 residue. In vitro and in vivo gain-of-function or loss-of-function analysis further demonstrated that targeting ApoJ promotes proteasomal degradation of mTOR, restores lipophagy and lysosomal activity, thus prevents hepatic lipid deposition. Moreover, an antagonist peptide with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.54 µM interacted with stress-induced ApoJ and improved hepatic pathology, serum lipid and glucose homeostasis, and insulin sensitivity in mice with NAFLD or type II diabetes mellitus.

While insulin resistance impacts cellular functions and systems within the skeletal muscle, it remains unclear whether the interaction of LDs and mitochondria is affected by exercise and the role of obesity and type 2 diabetes. By employing transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we aimed to investigate the effects of 1-hour ergometry cycling on LD morphology, subcellular distribution, and mitochondrial contact in skeletal muscle fibres of patients with type 2 diabetes and glucose-tolerant lean and obese controls, matched for equal exercise intensities. Exercise did not change LD volumetric density, numerical density, profile size, or subcellular distribution. However, evaluated as the magnitude of inter-organelle contact, exercise increased the contact between LDs and mitochondria with no differences between the three groups. This effect was most profound in the subsarcolemmal space of type 1 muscle fibres, and here the absolute contact length increased on average from ∼275 to ∼420 nm. Furthermore, the absolute contact length before exercise (ranging from ∼140 to ∼430 nm) was positively associated with the fat oxidation rate during exercise. In conclusion, we showed that acute exercise did not mediate changes in the LD volume fractions, numbers, or size but increased the contact between LDs and mitochondria, irrespective of obesity or type 2 diabetes. These data suggest that the increased LD-mitochondrial contact with exercise is not disturbed in obesity or type 2 diabetes. KEY POINTS: Type 2 diabetes is associated with altered interactivity between lipid droplets (LDs) and mitochondria in the skeletal muscle. Physical contact between the surface of LDs and the surrounding mitochondrial network is considered favorable for fat oxidation. We show that one hour of acute exercise increases the length of contact between LDs and mitochondria, irrespective of obesity or type 2 diabetes. This contact length between LDs and mitochondria is not associated with a net decrease in the LD volumetric density after the acute exercise. However, it correlates with the fat oxidation rate during exercise. Our data establish that exercise mediates contact between LDs and the mitochondrial network and that this effect is not impaired in individuals with type 2 diabetes or obesity. Abstract figure legend One hour of acute exercise increases the absolute and relative measured contact between lipid droplets and mitochondria, irrespective of obesity or type 2 diabetes. Increases in lipid droplet-mitochondrial contact were not associated with changes in lipid droplet content (volume fractions) nor volumetric composition (number or size).

Thus, we investigated the effects of Ro5-4864 on autophagy and the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant system in the sciatic nerves of DPN rats. All rats were randomly assigned to Sham or DPN group. After type 2 diabetes modelling (established by high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection) followed by behavioural tests, established DPN rats were randomly assigned to the DPN group, the Ro (TSPO agonist Ro5-4864) group, the Ro + 3-MA (autophagy inhibitor) group and the Ro + ML385 (Nrf2 inhibitor) group. Behavioural assessments were performed at baseline, on days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Sciatic nerves were collected on day 28 for immunofluorescence, morphological and western blot analyses. Ro5-4864 alleviated allodynia and increased myelin sheath thickness and myelin protein expression after DPN. Beclin-1 (p < 0.01) and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (p < 0.01) decreased and p62 (p < 0.01) accumulated in the DPN rats.

While universal risk factors for GD are reasonably well understood, questions remain regarding risks for women living with HIV (WLWH). We aimed to describe GD prevalence, evaluate associated maternal risk factors and assess specific birth outcomes in WLWH in the UK and Ireland. We analysed all pregnancies (≥24 weeks' gestation) in women diagnosed with HIV before delivery, reported to the UK-based Integrated Screening Outcomes Surveillance Service between 2010 and 2020. Every report of GD was considered as a case. A multivariable logistic regression model, adjusted for women with more than one pregnancy fitted with generalized estimating equations (GEE) assessed the effect of independent risk factors. There were 10,553 pregnancies in 7916 women, of which 460 (4.72%) pregnancies had reported GD. Overall, the median maternal age was 33 years (Q1:29-Q3:37), and 73% of pregnancies were in Black African women. WLWH with GD (WLWH-GD) were older (61% vs. 41% aged ≥35 years, p < 0.001) and more likely to be on treatment at conception (74% vs. 64%, p < 0.001) than women without GD. WLWH-GD were more likely to have a stillbirth (odds ratio [OR]: 5.38, 95% CI: 2.14-13.5), preterm delivery (OR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.95-3.32) and fetal macrosomia (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.24). Independent risk factors for GD included estimated year of delivery (GEE-adjusted odds ratio [GEE-aOR]: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.10-1.18), advanced maternal age (≥35 years) (GEE-aOR: 2.87, 95% CI: 1.54-5.34), Asian (GEE-aOR: 2.63, 95% CI: 1.40-4.63) and Black African (GEE-aOR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.13-2.12) ethnicity. Timing and type of antiretroviral therapy showed no evidence of a relationship with GD in multivariable analyses; however, women with a CD4 count ≤350 cells/μl were 27% less likely to have GD than women with CD4 counts >350 cells/μl (GEE-aOR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.50-0.96). GD prevalence increased over time among WLWH but was not significantly different from the general population. Maternal age, ethnicity and CD4 count were risk factors based on available data. Stillbirth and preterm delivery were more common in WLWH-GD than other WLWH over the study period. Further studies are required to build upon these results.","",""

However, the related molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Therefore, our study explored the mechanism of Dex in DPN using rat and RSC96 cell models. Sciatic nerve sections were observed under an optical microscope and the ultrastructure of the sciatic nerves was observed under a transmission electron microscope. Oxidative stress was assessed by detecting MDA, SOD, GSH-Px, and ROS levels. The motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT), and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) of rats were measured. Cell viability, apoptosis, and the changes in the expression of related genes and proteins were examined. Furthermore, the relationship between microRNA (miR)-34a and SIRT2 or SIRT2 and S1PR1 was analyzed. Dex reversed DPN-induced decreases in MNCV, MWT, and TWL. Dex alleviated oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and apoptosis in both the rat and RSC96 cell models of DPN. Mechanistically, miR-34a negatively targeted SIRT2, and SIRT2 inhibited S1PR1 transcription. The overexpression of miR-34a or S1PR1 or the inhibition of SIRT2 counteracted the neuroprotective effects of Dex in DPN in vivo and in vitro. Dex alleviates oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with DPN by downregulating miR-34a to regulate the SIRT2/S1PR1 axis.","",""

In this study, we illustrated that tilorone, a low-molecular-weight antiviral agent, improves glucose uptake in vitro and in vivo. Tilorone increased bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in C2C12 myoblasts, the transcription of multiple BMPs (BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, and BMP14), Smad4 expression, and the phosphorylation of BMP-mediated Smad1/5/8. The activation of Akt2/AS160 (TBC1D4) signaling, the critical regulator of GLUT4 translocation, was also increased, as well as the levels of GLUT4 and GLUT1, leading to enhanced uptake of the radioactively labeled glucose analog 18 F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18 FDG). However, this excess glucose content did not result in increased ATP formation by mitochondrial respiration; both basal and ATP-linked respiration were diminished, thereby contributing to the induction of AMPK. In differentiated myotubes, AS160 phosphorylation and 18 FDG uptake also increased. Moreover, tilorone administration further increased insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt2 and glucose uptake of myotubes indicating an insulin-sensitizing effect. Importantly, during in vivo experiments, the systemic administration of tilorone resulted in increased 18 FDG uptake of skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue in C57BL/6 mice. Our results provide new perspectives for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, which has a limited number of treatments that regulate protein expression or translocation.","",""

Therefore, we used MR to assess the association causality of type 1 diabetes (T1D) with fractures and osteoporosis. From a genome-wide association meta-analysis, independent single nucleotide polymorphisms closely associated with T1D were selected as instrumental variables. Data on fracture and osteoporosis were obtained from the FinnGen Consortium. We performed a two-sample MR analysis, using inverse-variance weighted (IVW) as the primary analysis method, to assess possible causal associations between T1D and bone risk. The results were verified by MR-Egger regression and median weighted method (WME). MR-PRESSO and MR-Egger intercepts were used to evaluate the horizontal pleiotropy of instrumental variables, and the Q-test and ""leave-one-out"" methods were used to test the heterogeneity of MR results.

Statins are one class of drug with the potential to prevent or delay the onset of several causes of incapacity in older age, particularly major cardiovascular disease (CVD). This paper presents the protocol for the STAtins in Reducing Events in the Elderly (STAREE) trial, a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial examining the effects of statins in community dwelling older people without CVD, diabetes or dementia. We will conduct a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial among people aged 70 years and over, recruited through Australian general practice and with no history of clinical CVD, diabetes or dementia. Participants will be randomly assigned to oral atorvastatin (40 mg daily) or matching placebo (1:1 ratio). The co-primary endpoints are disability-free survival defined as survival-free of dementia and persistent physical disability, and major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke). Secondary endpoints are all-cause death, dementia and other cognitive decline, persistent physical disability, fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non-fatal stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, fatal and non-fatal cancer, all-cause hospitalisation, need for permanent residential care and quality of life. Comparisons between assigned treatment arms will be on an intention-to-treat basis with each of the co-primary endpoints analysed separately in time-to-first-event analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression models. STAREE will address uncertainties about the preventive effects of statins on a range of clinical outcomes important to older people. Institutional ethics approval has been obtained. All research outputs will be disseminated to general practitioner co-investigators and participants, published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences.

There is a need to triage patients based on their individual risk. At present, patients are stratified according to retinopathy stage alone, yet other risk factors like glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) may be useful. Therefore, a prediction model that combines multiple prognostic factors to predict progression will be useful for triage in this setting to improve care.We previously developed a Diabetic Retinopathy Progression model to Treatment or Vision Loss (DRPTVL-UK) using a large primary care database. The aim of the present study is to externally validate the DRPTVL-UK model in a secondary care setting, specifically in a population under care by HES. This study will also provide an opportunity to update the model by considering additional predictors not previously available. We will use a retrospective cohort of 2400 patients with diabetes aged 12 years and over, referred from DESP to the NHS hospital trusts with referable DR between 2013 and 2016, with follow-up information recorded until December 2021.We will evaluate the external validity of the DRPTVL-UK model using measures of discrimination, calibration and net benefit.

Finally, hospitals were required to implement diabetes registries that were used by case managers for poorly controlled patients.The project timetable was from October 2018 to December 2021. Diabetes poor control (HbA1c >9%) showed improved mean difference of 12.7% (34.9% baseline, 22.2% after) with a p value of 0.01.

To clarify this aspect, we compared the pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by RYGB, which implies the early arrival of food to the ileum with duodenal exclusion, and through pre-duodenal ileal transposition (PdIT), with early arrival of food to the ileum but without duodenal exclusion, in a nondiabetic rodent model.

No surgery induced changes in blood glucose levels after the OGTT. However, RYGB induced a significant and strong insulin response that increased less in PdIT animals. Increased beta-cell mass was found in RYGB and PdIT animals as well as similar GLP-1 secretion and GLP-1 intestinal expression. However, differential GIP secretion and GIP duodenal expression were found between RYGB and PdIT. The RYGB effect on glucose metabolism is mostly due to early ileal stimulation; however, duodenal exclusion potentiates the ileal response within RYGB effects through enhanced GIP secretion.","",""

Residential greenness was assessed by using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and the weighting T2D-specific genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed based on previously published genome-wide association studies. Linear regression models and logistic regression models were used to investigate associations of residential greenness with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and T2D prevalence, respectively.

Some endogenous and urinary proteases, namely thrombin, trypsin, urokinase, and kallikrein released during diseased conditions, are responsible for activating different subtypes of PARs. Each PAR receptor subtype is involved in kidney disease of distinct aetiology. PAR1 and PAR2 have shown differential therapeutic outcomes in rodent models of type-1 and type-2 diabetic kidney diseases due to the distinct etiological basis of each disease type, however such findings need to be confirmed in other diabetic renal injury models. PAR1 and PAR2 blockers have been observed to abolish drug-induced nephrotoxicity in rodents by suppressing tubular inflammation and fibrosis and preventing mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, PAR2 inhibition improved autophagy and prevented fibrosis, inflammation, and remodeling in the urethral obstruction model. Only the PAR1/4 subtypes have emerged as a therapeutic target for treating experimentally induced nephrotic syndrome, where their respective antibodies attenuated the podocyte apoptosis induced upon thrombin activation. Strikingly PAR2 and PAR4 subtypes involvement has been tested in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal ischemia-reperfusion injury models. Thus, more studies are required to delineate the role of other subtypes in the sepsis-AKI model. Evidence suggests that PARs regulate oxidative, inflammatory stress, immune cell activation, fibrosis, autophagic flux, and apoptosis during kidney diseases.","",""

The treatment with sulfonylurea is no longer recommended because of its side effects and higher mortality compared to the modern treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.

Three phase 3 trials (PRASTRO-I/II/III) were conducted to determine the efficacy of prasugrel in preventing recurrent stroke. Here, we performed an integrated analysis of these studies to confirm the generalizability of the PRASTRO-III findings and to supplement the small sample size of the study. Patients from PRASTRO-I, PRASTRO-II, and PRASTRO-III with ischemic stroke (large-artery atherosclerosis or small-artery occlusion) and at least one of the following were included: hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or ischemic stroke history. The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite incidence of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and death from other vascular causes in the intention-to-treat population. Bleeding events (life-threatening bleeding, major bleeding, and clinically relevant bleeding) were evaluated as the primary safety endpoint. Cumulative incidences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for the study outcomes using the Kaplan-Meier method. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using the Cox regression model. The data of 2,184, 274, and 230 patients from PRASTRO-I, PRASTRO-II, and PRASTRO-III, respectively, were analyzed (N = 2,688; prasugrel, N = 1,337; clopidogrel, N = 1,351). Stroke at enrollment was classified as large-artery atherosclerosis in 49.3% of patients and small-artery occlusion in 50.7% of patients. The primary efficacy endpoint composite incidence (prasugrel vs. clopidogrel) was 3.4% versus 4.3% (HR: 0.771, 95% CI: 0.522-1.138). The incidence of each component of the primary efficacy endpoint for prasugrel versus clopidogrel was 3.1% (n = 41) versus 4.1% (n = 55) for ischemic stroke, 0.3% (n = 4) versus 0.2% (n = 3) for MI, and no events of death from other vascular causes. For the primary safety endpoint, bleeding events were reported in 6.0% of patients in the prasugrel group versus 5.5% of patients in the clopidogrel group (HR: 1.074, 95% CI: 0.783-1.473). This integrated analysis supports the findings of PRASTRO-III. Prasugrel is a promising treatment that results in a numerical reduction in the composite incidence of ischemic stroke, MI, and death from other vascular causes in patients with ischemic stroke who are at a high risk of stroke recurrence. No major safety issues were observed for prasugrel.","",""

Data were obtained from a cohort study of community-dwelling older adults aged ≥60 years in Bangkok, Thailand between October 1, 2019, and September 30, 2021. Current HD was defined as a serum osmolality >300 mOsm/kg. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with current and impending HD. The risk score for current HD was developed based on the final multiple logistic regression model. A total of 704 participants were included in the final analysis. In this study, 59 (8.4%) participants had current HD and 152 (21.6%) had impending HD. We identified three risk factors for HD in older adults; age ≥ 75 years (adjusted odds ratio (aORs) 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-3.46), underlying diabetes mellitus (aORs 3.07, 95%CI: 1.77-5.31) and use of ß-blocker medication (aORs 1.98, 95%CI: 1.04-3.78).

Some studies have emphasized that metabolic syndrome, which includes obesity and diabetes, leads to increased risks of dementia and cognitive decline. Factors such as insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and central obesity in metabolic syndrome are associated with synaptic failure, neuroinflammation, and imbalanced neurotransmitter levels, leading to the progression of dementia. Due to the positive correlation between diabetes and dementia, some studies have called it ""type 3 diabetes"". Recently, the number of patients with cognitive decline due to metabolic imbalances has considerably increased. In addition, recent studies have reported that neuropsychiatric issues such as anxiety, depressive behavior, and impaired attention are common factors in patients with metabolic disease and those with dementia. In the central nervous system (CNS), the amygdala is a central region that regulates emotional memory, mood disorders, anxiety, attention, and cognitive function. The connectivity of the amygdala with other brain regions, such as the hippocampus, and the activity of the amygdala contribute to diverse neuropathological and neuropsychiatric issues. Thus, this review summarizes the significant consequences of the critical roles of amygdala connectivity in both metabolic syndromes and dementia. Further studies on amygdala function in metabolic imbalance-related dementia are needed to treat neuropsychiatric problems in patients with this type of dementia.","",""

This study aimed to examine the association between self-stigma and psychological outcomes among T2DM patients in Hong Kong. Self-stigma was hypothesized to be associated with higher psychological distress and lower quality of life (QoL). Such associations were also hypothesized to be mediated by lower perceived social support, lower self-care self-efficacy, plus higher self-perceived burden to significant others. T2DM patients (N = 206) recruited from hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong were invited to complete a cross-sectional survey measuring the aforementioned variables. After controlling for covariates, multiple mediation analysis results indicated the indirect effects from self-stigma to psychological distress via increased self-perceived burden (β = 0.07; 95% CI = 0.02, 0.15) and decreased self-care self-efficacy (β = 0.05; 95% CI = 0.01, 0.11) were significant.

These challenges also apply to the paediatric population, leading to a reduction in paediatric hospital beds and occupancy rates. Paediatric hospital-at-home (HAH) care is used to substitute hospital care in an attempt to bring hospital services closer to children's homes. In addition, these models attempt to avoid fragmentation of care between hospitals and the community. An important prerequisite for this paediatric HAH care is that it is safe and at least as effective as standard hospital care. The aim of this systematic review is to analyse the evidence on the impact of paediatric HAH care on hospital utilisation, patient outcomes and costs. Four bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, Cinahl and Cochrane Library) were systematically searched for RCTs and pseudo-RCTs that studied the effectiveness and safety of short-term paediatric HAH care with a focus on models as an alternative to acute hospital admissions. Pseudo-RCTs are defined as observational studies that mimic the design of an RCT, but without randomisation. Outcomes of interest were the length of stay, acute (re)admissions, adverse health outcomes, therapy adherence, parental satisfaction or experience and costs. Only articles written in English, Dutch and French conducted in upper-middle and high-income countries and published between 2000 and 2021 were included. Quality assessment was carried out by two assessors using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias. Reporting is done in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We identified 18 (pseudo) RCTs and 25 publications of low to very low quality. Most of the included RCTs focused on the neonatal population: phototherapy for neonatal jaundice, early discharge after birth combined with outpatient neonatal care. Other RCTs focused on chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, diabetes type 1 education, oxygen therapy for acute bronchiolitis, an outpatient service for children with infectious diseases and antibiotic treatment for low-risk febrile neutropenia, cellulitis and perforated appendicitis. The identified study results show that paediatric HAH care is not associated with more adverse events or hospital readmissions. The impact of paediatric HAH care on costs is less clear.  Conclusions: This review suggests that paediatric HAH care is not associated with more adverse events or hospital readmissions for various clinical indications compared to a standard hospital. Because of the low to very low level of evidence, it is worthwhile to further investigate safety, efficacy and cost effects under strict and well-controlled conditions. This systematic review provides guidance on the essential elements that should be included in HAH care programmes for each type of indication and/or intervention. What is Known: • The hospital landscape is shifting new models of care to meet current challenges in demand, technology, staffing and models of care. Paediatric HAH care is one of these models. Previous literature reviews are inconclusive whether this is a safe and effective way of providing care. What is New: • New evidence suggests that paediatric HAH care for various clinical indications is not associated with adverse events or hospital readmissions compared to a standard hospital. Current evidence is characterised by a low level of quality.  • The current review provides guidance on the essential elements that should be included in HAH care programmes for each type of indication and/or intervention.","",""

Aberrant thrombosis is a common feature of systemic conditions like diabetes and obesity, and chronic inflammatory diseases like atherosclerosis, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Upon vascular injury, usually the coagulation system, platelets, and endothelium act in an orchestrated manner to prevent bleeding by forming a clot at the site of the injury. Abnormalities in this process lead to either excessive bleeding or uncontrolled thrombosis/insufficient antithrombotic activity, which translates into vessel occlusion and its sequelae. The FeCl3-induced carotid injury model is a valuable tool in probing how thrombosis initiates and progresses in vivo. This model involves endothelial damage/denudation and subsequent clot formation at the injured site. It provides a highly sensitive, quantitative assay to monitor vascular damage and clot formation in response to different degrees of vascular damage. Once optimized, this standard technique can be used to study the molecular mechanisms underlying thrombosis, as well as the ultrastructural changes in platelets in a growing thrombus. This assay is also useful to study the efficacy of antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents.

The AVF operations in these patients were newly created by the same physician. We analyzed the AVF patency rates using the chi-square test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to explore risk factors for AVF failure. Survival analysis was performed to explore AVF survival at different serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations. Logistic regression analyses showed that male sex; age; BMI; serum albumin, triglyceride, phosphorus, 25(OH)D, iPTH and hemoglobin levels, history of hypertension, CHD, diabetes, stroke, and antiplatelet drug use; and smoking habits were not risk factors for AVF failure. The failure incidence rates of AVF in subjects in the VD deficiency and non VD deficiency group were not statistically significant (25.0% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.344). The AVF failure incidence rates at 1, 3, and 5 years in the patients with 25(OH)D levels more than 20 ng/mL were 26%, 29%, and 37%, respectively, and the one-year AVF failure incidence rates were 27% in the patients with 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/mL.

We investigated the impact of hyperglycemia developing during pregnancy (gestational diabetes mellitus, GDM) or already present pre-mating (pre-gestational diabetes mellitus, PDM) on maternal health and pregnancy outcomes. GDM and PDM were induced in C57BL/6NTac mice by combined 60% high fat diet (HF) and low dose streptozotocin (STZ). Animals were screened for PDM prior to mating, all underwent an OGTT on gestational day (GD)15. Tissues were collected at GD18 or at postnatal day (PN)15. Among HFSTZ-treated dams, 34% developed PDM and 66% developed GDM, characterized by impaired glucose-induced insulin release and inadequate suppression of endogenous glucose production. No increased adiposity or overt insulin resistance was observed. Furthermore, markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were significantly increased in PDM at GD18 and were positively correlated with basal glucose levels at GD18 in GDM dams. By PN15, NAFLD markers were also increased in GDM dams. Only PDM affected pregnancy outcomes such as litter size. Our findings indicate that GDM and PDM, resulting in disturbances of maternal glucose homeostasis, increase the risk of postpartum NAFLD development, related to the onset and severity of pregnancy hyperglycemia. These findings signal a need for earlier monitoring of maternal glycemia and more rigorous follow-up of maternal health after GDM and PDM pregnancy in humans. KEY POINTS: We studied the impact of high-fat diet/streptozotocin induced hyperglycemia in pregnancy (HIP) in mice and found that this impaired glucose tolerance and insulin release. Litter size and embryo survival were compromised by pre-gestational, but not by gestational diabetes. Despite postpartum recovery from hyperglycemia in a majority of dams, liver disease markers were further elevated by PN15. Maternal liver disease markers were associated with the severity of hyperglycemia at GD18. The association between hyperglycemic exposure and NAFLD signal a need for more rigorous monitoring and follow-up of maternal glycemia and health in diabetic pregnancy in humans. Abstract figure legend Streptozotocin and high fat diet were used to induce GDM in female BL6/NTac mice. Pregnant dams underwent an OGTT at GD15 to confirm GDM diagnosis. By GD18, dams were hyperglycemic and showed a reduction in pancreatic beta cells.

Insomnia severity significantly moderated the association between OSA severity and mood (b = -0.048, p = .017). Although insomnia severity did not moderate the relationship between OSA severity and diabetes-related distress (b = -0.009, p = .458), insomnia severity was independently associated with greater diabetes-related distress (b = 1.133, p < .001). In adults with T2D and OSA, as insomnia severity increased, increasing OSA severity was associated with lower level of mood disturbances. Insomnia independently increased the level of diabetes-related distress.

Genetic, metabolic, multiple lifestyle, and sociodemographic factors are known as related to high T2DM risk. Dietary lipids and lipid metabolism are significant metabolic modulators in T2DM and T2DM-related complications. Besides, accumulated evidence suggests that altered gut microbiota which plays an important role in the metabolic health of the host contributes significantly to T2DM involving impaired or improved glucose and lipid metabolism. At this point, dietary lipids may affect host physiology and health via interaction with the gut microbiota. Besides, increasing evidence in the literature suggests that lipidomics as novel parameters detected with holistic analytical techniques have important roles in the pathogenesis and progression of T2DM, through various mechanisms of action including gut-brain axis modulation. A better understanding of the roles of some nutrients and lipidomics in T2DM through gut microbiota interactions will help develop new strategies for the prevention and treatment of T2DM. However, this issue has not yet been entirely discussed in the literature.

In addition to the hypoglycemic effect, we examined the improvement in cardiac contraction/relaxation ability, cardiac fibrosis, and myocardial hypertrophy by EVO treatment. To identify the mechanisms underlying the improvement in diabetic cardiomyopathy by EVO treatment, its effect on lipotoxicity and the mitochondrial damage caused by lipid droplet accumulation in the myocardium were analyzed. EVO lowered the blood glucose and HbA1c levels and improved insulin sensitivity but did not affect the body weight or blood lipid profile. Cardiac systolic/diastolic function, hypertrophy, and fibrosis were improved in the EVO-treated group. EVO prevented cardiac lipotoxicity by reducing the accumulation of lipid droplets in the myocardium through suppression of CD36, ACSL1, FABP3, PPARgamma, and DGAT1 and enhancement of the phosphorylation of FOXO1, indicating its inhibition. The EVO-mediated improvement in mitochondrial function and reduction in damage were achieved through activation of PGC1a/NRF1/TFAM, which activates mitochondrial biogenesis. RNA-seq results for the whole heart confirmed that EVO treatment mainly affected the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to lipid metabolism. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that EVO improves cardiac function by reducing lipotoxicity and mitochondrial injury and provides a potential therapeutic option for DCM.","",""

There was a significant interaction between sleep score and glucose tolerance status on CVD (P for interaction = 0.002). Each 1 point increment in sleep score was associated with a 7% (95% confidence interval 6%-9%), 11% (8%-14%), and 13% (9%-17%) higher risk of CVD among participants with NGT, prediabetes, and diabetes, respectively. Similar interaction patterns were observed for CHD and stroke. Among the individual sleep factors, sleep duration and insomnia significantly interacted with glucose tolerance status on CVD outcomes (all P for interaction <0.05). All five unhealthy sleep factors accounted for 14.2% (8.7%-19.8%), 19.5% (7.4%-31.0%), and 25.1% (9.7%-39.3%) of incident CVD cases among participants with NGT, prediabetes, and diabetes, respectively. The CVD risk associated with a poor sleep pattern was exacerbated across glucose intolerance status. Our findings emphasise the importance of integrating sleep management into a lifestyle modification programme, particularly in people with prediabetes or diabetes.","",""

The endothelin pathway is a critical regulator of microcirculatory function and may exhibit sexual dichotomy where healthy pre-menopausal women have greater endothelin-B receptor (ETBR) function compared to men. Moreover, T1D may differentially alter muscle oxidative capacity in men and women, however, if ETBR function is impaired in women compared to men with T1D and its relationship with muscle oxidative capacity has yet to be explored. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if ETBR-mediated dilation is impaired in women compared to men with T1D and if this is related to their skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Men (n=9; HbA1c=7.8±1.0%) and women (N=10 women; HbA1c=8.4±1.3%) with uncomplicated T1D were recruited for this investigation. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and intradermal microdialysis (750nM BQ-123+ET-1 [10-20-10-8 mol/L]) were utilized to evaluate skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and assess ETBR-mediated vasodilation, respectively. Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity was significantly lower (p=0.031) in women compared with men with T1D. However, ETBR-mediated dilation induced a significantly greater (p=0.012) vasodilatory response in women compared to men with T1D, and the AUC was negatively associated with skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (r=-0.620; p=0.042). Compared to men with uncomplicated T1D, muscle oxidative capacity was lower and ETBR-mediated vasodilation was higher in women with uncomplicated T1D. ETBR-induced vasodilatory capacity was inversely related to skeletal muscle oxidative capacity, suggesting that there may be compensatory mechanisms occurring to preserve microvascular blood flow in women with T1D.","",""

We sought to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban versus warfarin in nonvalvular AF (NVAF) patients with concomitant OSA. Methods  This was an analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data from November 2010 to December 2021. We included adults with NVAF and OSA at baseline, newly initiated on rivaroxaban or warfarin, and with ≥12 months of prior EHR activity. Patients with valvular disease, alternative indications for oral anticoagulation, or who were pregnant were excluded. The incidence rates of developing stroke or systemic embolism (SSE) and bleeding-related hospitalization were evaluated. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using propensity score-overlap weighted proportional hazards regression. Multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed. Results  We included 21,940 rivaroxaban (20.1% at the 15 mg dose) and 38,213 warfarin (time-in-therapeutic range = 47.3 ± 28.3%) patients. Rivaroxaban was found to have similar hazard of SSE compared to warfarin (HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.82-1.03). Rivaroxaban was associated with a reduced rate of bleeding-related hospitalizations (HR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.78-0.92) versus warfarin, as well as reductions in intracranial (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.62-0.94) and extracranial (HR = 0.89, 95%CI = 0.81-0.97) bleeding. Upon sensitivity analysis restricting the population to men with a CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score ≥2 or women with a score ≥3, rivaroxaban was associated with a significant 33% risk reduction in SSE and 43% reduction in the risk of bleeding-related hospitalization. No significant interaction for the SSE or bleeding-related hospitalization outcomes was observed upon subgroup analyses. Conclusion  Among patients with NVAF and OSA, rivaroxaban had similar SSE risk versus warfarin but was associated with reductions in any intracranial and extracranial bleeding-related hospitalizations. Rivaroxaban was associated with significant reductions in SSE and bleeding-related hospitalizations when the study population was restricted to patients with a moderate-to-high risk of SSE. These data should provide prescribers with additional confidence in selecting rivaroxaban in NVAF patients who have OSA at the time of anticoagulation initiation.","",""

The risk of obesity and other chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, tooth destruction, as well as dental cavities, increases proportionally with the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). This study intends to determine the prevalence of SSB intake among adults in the Perambalur area of Tamil Nadu, India, as well as the factors that influence it. Methodology We surveyed 1007 individuals using a cross-sectional design from June to November 2022. We included residents who were at least 18 years old and less than 80 years old. Using a convenience sample method, we gathered responses from the public in the urban and rural field practice areas of a teaching medical college in the district of Perambalur, India. We conducted in-person interviews to get data regarding the consumption of SSBs. Among other socio-demographic information, the participants' names, ages, religions, levels of education and employment, household incomes, family compositions, marital statuses, lifestyle behaviors, and comorbid conditions were also gathered. We measured the SSB consumption frequency and duration, and we also considered the contexts in which they consumed SSBs. We examined the factors that play a role in SSB consumption and questioned the participants' familiarity with SSBs' constituents, adverse effects, and cumulative toll. Besides examining the effects of SSB use, the research also explores the possibility of reducing or stopping it altogether. Results The prevalence of SSB use among the current study population was 96.3%. Half of the population has consumed SSBs, between 100 and 200 ml, for over 10 years. Taste and peer pressure are the primary reasons for facilitating SSBs, whereas the media has a minor impact. Most of the population (69%) began consuming SSBs, mostly during vacations and at parties. About one-fifth of the population experiences negative consequences after ingesting SSBs, while only half of the population is aware of the contents of SSBs. Likewise, just 50% of the population is aware of the long-term implications of SSBs. Nearly 16.7% of the population attempted to stop using SSBs. Being overweight, belonging to a high socioeconomic class, and dwelling in a rural location are risk factors related to the consumption of SSBs. Conclusion The prevalence of SSB use among the current study population is exceptionally high. Being overweight, belonging to a high socioeconomic class, and dwelling in a rural location are risk factors related to the consumption of SSBs. There is a need to educate the public about the short- and long-term negative effects of consuming SSBs.

Using a stepwise multivariate regression analysis, the odds of having CRC among patients with CD was 10.18 (95% CI 9.72-10.65) (P-value <0.001). The odds also remained high among males 1.49 (95% CI 1.36-1.63), African Americans 1.51 (95% CI 1.35-1.68), patients who have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 2.71 (95% CI 2.66-2.76), are smokers 2.49 (95% CI 2.44-2.54), are obese 2.21 (95% CI 2.17-2.25), and are alcoholic 1.72 (95% CI 1.66-1.78). Our study demonstrates that patients with CD are frequently found to have CRC even when adjusting for common risk factors.

Furthermore, a strong positive correlation was revealed between %CV and %WC in the five groups on day 7 (r=0.736; P=0.0003). These findings indicated that topical application of combined PE and SIM could enhance wound healing by upregulating angiogenesis and reducing neutrophil infiltration in mice with diabetic wounds.","",""

Our results revealed that on Santiago Island, 24 native plants are used in traditional medicine. The main uses of these species (e.g., forage, timber, food and fibres), their medicinal applications, the plant parts used, their mode of administration and conservation status are presented here for the first time. Moreover, the pharmacological characterization of two native tree species revealed that hydroethanolic extracts were richer in phenolic compounds and more active than their aqueous counterparts. All the studied extracts revealed significant antioxidant properties (DPPH and FRAP assays) and were generally moderately active against Gram-positive bacteria. All the extracts inhibited the activities of the carbohydrate digestive enzymes α-glucosidase and α-amylase in a dose-dependent manner. For α-glucosidase, the detected inhibitory activity (IC50 values from 2.0 ± 0.2 μg/mL to 9.9 ± 1.2 μg/mL) was significantly higher than that of acarbose, suggesting that extracts of both species can delay glucose absorption, thereby assisting in slowing down the progression of diabetes. Our findings highlight the crucial importance that medicinal plants have for the Cabo Verdean population, while also raising awareness on the need for sustainable use and conservation of native flora, and of tree species traded in local markets in particular.","",""

Our past works show glucolipid dysregulation resulting from perinatal exposure to the commercial penta-mixture of PBDEs, DE-71, in C57BL/6 female mice. As a comparison, in the current study, the effects of DE-71 on glucose homeostasis in male offspring was examined. C57BL/6N dams were exposed to DE-71 at 0.1 mg/kg/d (L-DE-71), 0.4 mg/kg/d (H-DE-71), or received corn oil vehicle (VEH/CON) for a total of 10 wks, including gestation and lactation and their male offspring were examined in adulthood. Compared to VEH/CON, DE-71 exposure produced hypoglycemia after a 11 h fast (H-DE-71). An increased fast duration from 9 to 11 h resulted in lower blood glucose in both DE-71 exposure groups. In vivo glucose challenge showed marked glucose intolerance (H-DE-71) and incomplete clearance (L- and H-DE-71). Moreover, L-DE-71-exposed mice showed altered glucose responses to exogenous insulin, including incomplete glucose clearance and/or utilization. In addition, L-DE-71 produced elevated levels of plasma glucagon and the incretin, active glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) but no changes were detected in insulin. These alterations, which represent criteria used clinically to diagnose diabetes in humans, were accompanied with reduced hepatic glutamate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity, elevated adrenal epinephrine and decreased thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass, indicating involvement of several organ system targets of PBDEs. Liver levels of several endocannabinoid species were not altered. Our findings demonstrate that chronic, low-level exposure to PBDEs in dams can dysregulate glucose homeostasis and glucoregulatory hormones in their male offspring. Previous findings using female siblings show altered glucose homeostasis that aligned with a contrasting diabetogenic phenotype, while their mothers displayed more subtle glucoregulatory alterations, suggesting that developing organisms are more susceptible to DE-71. We summarize the results of the current work, generated in males, considering previous findings in females. Collectively, these findings offer a comprehensive account of differential effects of environmentally relevant PBDEs on glucose homeostasis and glucoregulatory endocrine dysregulation of developmentally exposed male and female mice.","",""

Aristaless-related homeobox (Arx) gene encodes protein which plays an important role in the development of pancreatic alpha cells and is a main target for changing alpha cell identity. In this study we used CRISPR/dCas9-based epigenetic tools for targeted hypermethylation of Arx gene promoter and its subsequent suppression in mouse pancreatic αTC1-6 cell line. Bisulfite sequencing and methylation profiling revealed that the dCas9-Dnmt3a3L-KRAB single chain fusion constructs (EpiCRISPR) was the most efficient. Epigenetic silencing of Arx expression was accompanied by an increase in transcription of the insulin gene (Ins2) mRNA on 5th and 7th post-transfection day, quantified by both RT-qPCR and RNA-seq. Insulin production and secretion was determined by immunocytochemistry and ELISA assay, respectively. Eventually, we were able to induce switch of approximately 1% of transiently transfected cells which were able to produce 35% more insulin than Mock transfected alpha cells. In conclusion, we successfully triggered a direct, transient switch of pancreatic alpha to insulin-producing cells opening a future research on promising therapeutic avenue for diabetes management.","",""

The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of proximal sciatic nerve's FA on different distal nerve fiber deficits of the upper and lower limbs and its correlation with the neuroaxonal biomarker, neurofilament light chain protein (NfL). Sixty-nine patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and 30 healthy controls underwent detailed clinical and electrophysiological assessments, complete quantitative sensory testing (QST), and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance neurography of the sciatic nerve. NfL was measured in the serum of healthy controls and patients with T2DM. Multivariate models were used to adjust for confounders of microvascular damage. Patients with DSPN showed a 17% lower sciatic microstructural integrity compared to healthy controls (p<0.001). FA correlated with tibial and peroneal motor nerve conduction velocity (NCV) (r=0.6; p<0.001 and r=0.6; p<0.001) and sural sensory NCV (r=0.50; p<0.001).

Considerations for such transitions include final adult height, fertility, fetal risk, heritability, and access to appropriately identified specialists. A nutrient-dense diet, optimal mobility, and adequate vitamin D stores are protective factors for these conditions. Primary bone disorders include hypophosphatasia, X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, and osteogenesis imperfecta. Metabolic bone disease can also develop secondarily as a sequela of such diverse exposures as hypogonadism, a history of eating disorder, and cancer treatment. This article synthesizes research by experts of these specific disorders to describe what is known in this field of transition medicine for metabolic bone diseases as well as unanswered questions.

Diabetic foot is one of the most severe complications of diabetes, which often places a heavy economic burden on patients and seriously affects their quality of life. The current conventional treatment for the diabetic foot can only relieve the symptoms or delay the progression of the disease but cannot repair damaged blood vessels and nerves. An increasing number of studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can promote angiogenesis and re-epithelialization, participate in immune regulation, reduce inflammation, and finally repair diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), rendering it an effective means of treating diabetic foot disease. Currently, stem cells used in the treatment of diabetic foot are divided into two categories: autologous and allogeneic. They are mainly derived from the bone marrow, umbilical cord, adipose tissue, and placenta. MSCs from different sources have similar characteristics and subtle differences. Mastering their features to better select and use MSCs is the premise of improving the therapeutic effect of DFU.

Skeletal muscle is a heterogeneous tissue composed of different muscle fiber types that contribute distinctly to IR development. Glucose transport shows more protection in slow-twitch muscles than in fast-twitch muscles during IR development, while the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the role of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in the distinct resistance of two types of muscle in IR. Male Wistar rats were divided into high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and control groups. We measured glucose transport, mitochondrial respiration, UPRmt and histone methylation modification of UPRmt-related proteins to examine the UPRmt in the slow fiber-enriched soleus (Sol) and fast fiber-enriched tibialis anterior (TA) under HFD conditions. Our results indicate that 18 weeks of HFD can cause systemic IR, while the disturbance of Glut4-dependent glucose transport only occurred in fast-twitch muscle. The expression levels of UPRmt markers, including ATF5, HSP60 and ClpP, and the UPRmt-related mitokine MOTS-c were significantly higher in slow-twitch muscle than in fast-twitch muscle under HFD conditions. Mitochondrial respiratory function is maintained only in slow-twitch muscle. Additionally, in the Sol, histone methylation at the ATF5 promoter region was significantly higher than that in the TA after HFD feeding. The expression of proteins involved in glucose transport in slow-twitch muscle remains almost unaltered after HFD intervention, whereas a significant decline of these proteins was observed in fast-twitch muscle. Specific activation of the UPRmt in slow-twitch muscle, accompanied by higher mitochondrial respiratory function and MOTS-c expression, may contribute to the higher resistance to HFD in slow-twitch muscle. Notably, the different histone modifications of UPRmt regulators may underlie the specific activation of the UPRmt in different muscle types. However, future work applying genetic or pharmacological approaches should further uncover the relationship between the UPRmt and insulin resistance.","",""

While clinical and biochemical profiles present just real-time snapshots of the patients' health, efficient computation models of the pathological disturbance of biomolecular processes are required to achieve individualized mechanistic insights into disease progression. Here, we describe the Generalized metabolic flux analysis (GMFA) for addressing this gap. Suitably grouping individual metabolites/fluxes into pools simplifies the analysis of the resulting more coarse-grain network. We also map non-metabolic clinical modalities onto the network with additional edges. Instead of using the time coordinate, the system status (metabolite concentrations and fluxes) is quantified as function of a generalized extent variable (a coordinate in the space of generalized metabolites) that represents the system's coordinate along its evolution path and evaluates the degree of change between any two states on that path. We applied GMFA to analyze Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) patients from two cohorts: EVAS (289 patients from Singapore) and NHANES (517) from the USA. Personalized systems biology models (digital twins) were constructed. We deduced disease dynamics from the individually parameterized metabolic network and predicted the evolution path of the metabolic health state. For each patient, we obtained an individual description of disease dynamics and predict an evolution path of the metabolic health state. Our predictive models achieve an ROC-AUC in the range 0.79-0.95 (sensitivity 80-92%, specificity 62-94%) in identifying phenotypes at the baseline and predicting future development of diabetic retinopathy and cataract progression among T2DM patients within 3 years from the baseline. The GMFA method is a step towards realizing the ultimate goal to develop practical predictive computational models for diagnostics based on systems biology. This tool has potential use in chronic disease management in medical practice. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13755-023-00218-x.","",""

There were no significant differences between patients with warfarin and DOACs regarding thrombotic events (HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.68-2.42), but warfarin was associated with higher bleeding/safety events (HR: 4.29; 95% CI: 2.82-6.52) and persistence events (HR: 4.51; 95% CI: 3.81 -5.33). The patients with NVAF in this study were mainly older adults with multiple comorbidities. Compared to warfarin, DOACs were found to be equally effective, but safer and had a lower probability of discontinuation or switch.","",""

Studies of monozygotic twins may provide a unique opportunity for clarifying how these processes inter-relate. This paper describes the rationale, characteristics, and initial findings of a longitudinal co-twin study aimed at examining the biopsychosocial mechanisms linking depression and risk of diabetes in mid-life. Participants in the Mood and Immune Regulation in Twins (MIRT) Study were recruited from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry. MIRT consisted of 94 individuals who do not have diabetes at baseline, representing 43 twin pairs (41 monozygotic and 2 dizygotic), one set of monozygotic triplets, and 5 individuals whose co-twin did not participate. A broad set of variables were assessed including psychological factors (e.g., lifetime history major depression (MD)); social factors (e.g., stress perceptions and experiences); and biological factors, including indicators of metabolic risk (e.g., BMI, blood pressure (BP), HbA1c) and immune functioning (e.g., pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines), as well as collection of RNA. Participants were re-assessed 6-month later. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and descriptive comparisons were used to explore variation in these psychological, social, and biological factors across time and within pairs. Mean age was 53 years, 68% were female, and 77% identified as white. One-third had a history of MD, and 18 sibling sets were discordant for MD. MD was associated with higher systolic (139.1 vs 132.2 mmHg, p=0.05) and diastolic BP (87.2 vs. 80.8 mmHg, p=0.002) and IL-6 (1.47 vs. 0.93 pg/mL, p=0.001). MD was not associated with BMI, HbA1c, or other immune markers. While the biological characteristics of the co-twins were significantly correlated, all within-person ICCs were higher than the within-pair correlations (e.g., HbA1c within-person ICC=0.88 vs. within-pair ICC=0.49; IL-6 within-person ICC=0.64 vs. within-pair=0.54). Among the pairs discordant for MD, depression was not substantially associated with metabolic or immune markers, but was positively associated with stress. Twin studies have the potential to clarify the biopsychosocial processes linking depression and diabetes, and recently completed processing of RNA samples from MIRT permits future exploration of gene expression as a potential mechanism.","",""

This mixed-methods analysis seeks to evaluate the practice of solitary confinement on mental and physical health using data from a sample of 99 men in Pennsylvania. We first describe patterns of multimorbidity among men in solitary confinement using a latent class analysis to group individuals with shared demographic attributes and mental and physical health conditions. We then use thematic analysis to explore how men from each of these groups experienced and managed health concerns in solitary confinement. Our findings describe significant physical and mental health burdens and unmet healthcare needs. Over three-quarters of respondents reported a physical health diagnosis such as heart disease or diabetes, and over half reported a mental health diagnosis, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Those with pre-existing, often multiple, health issues struggled to maintain their health given restrictions to daily living, isolated idle time, and limited healthcare access in solitary confinement. These aspects of solitary confinement also challenged those who entered solitary in relatively good health. These findings demonstrate the struggle for self-advocacy in maintaining health and healthcare access under extreme conditions of confinement and point to the need to prevent the health harms of solitary confinement by further restricting its use.","",""

Numerous factors including low water solubility, poor intestinal permeability, instability at alkaline pH, and fast metabolism contribute to curcumin's limited oral bioavailability. In order to improve its oral bioavailability, different formulation techniques such as coadministration with piperine, incorporation into micelles, micro/nanoemulsions, nanoparticles, liposomes, solid dispersions, spray drying, and noncovalent complex formation with galactomannosides have been investigated with in vitro cell culture models, in vivo animal models, and humans.

Neurons were exposed to high glucose (45 mM) for 24 or 48 hours and compared to time-matched controls (25 mM). Neurons were stained for neuron-specific beta-tubulin, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, vesicular acetylcholine transferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling) assay. Schwann cells were dissociated from MPGs of healthy male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 4) and grown to confluence. Additional Sprague Dawley rats were made diabetic with streptozotocin (50 mg/kg, n = 4), and 5 weeks later MPGs were collected from these rats, dissociated, and cocultured on healthy SCs. Neurons and SCs were stained with beta-tubulin and S100. Length, branching, and survival of nitrergic, parasympathetic, and sympathetic neurons was assessed in neurons exposed to normal or high glucose concentrations, and neuron length was measured in neuron-SC coculture. The total number of neurons and the length and number of branches were significantly decreased after 24 and 48 hours of high glucose (P < .05). The percentage of nitrergic neurons decreased 10% after 24 hours and 50% after 48 hours of high glucose (P < .05). After 24 hours of high glucose, cholinergic-positive neurons were unchanged; however, these neurons decreased 30% after 48 hours (P < .05). The proportion of sympathetic neurons increased 25% after 48 hours of high glucose (P < .05). At both timepoints, there was a 2-fold increase in the total apoptotic neurons with high glucose (P < .05). Neurite outgrowth recovered to control lengths after coculture of diabetic neurons with healthy SCs (P < .05). Glucose can be used as a tool to investigate the direct effects of DM on neuritogenesis. Our data suggest that an effective treatment for DM ED protects and repairs the penile neuronal supply. Exposing MPG neurons to high glucose offers a quick and, inexpensive proxy for DM-related conditions. A limitation of our study is that our model reflects type 1 DM, whereas clinically, most diabetic ED patients have type 2 DM. Culturing pelvic neurons in high glucose can be used as a tool to elucidate how to protect proerectile neurons from cell death and may lead to new therapeutic strategies for diabetic men suffering from ED.","",""

In Japan, no oral drugs or devices are approved or used clinically to treat PE. The Men's Training Cup Keep Training (MTCK), a masturbation aid, was developed for PE. MTCK offers 5 grades of tightness and strength. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of the MTCK in patients who are unable to delay ejaculation. Inclusion criteria were 20- to 60-year-old men feeling distressed and frustrated by PE and who had the same sexual partners throughout the study period. Exclusion criteria were neurologic disease and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, as well as the use of antidepressants, α-blockers, and 5α-reductase inhibitors. The protocol comprised an 8-week training period with the MTCK from level 1 to level 5, with each level used twice before moving to the next level. The main outcome measure was the extension of intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT). The secondary outcome measures were score improvements on the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool, Sexual Health Inventory for Men, Erection Hardness Score, and Difficulty in Performing Sexual Intercourse Questionnaire-5. We enrolled 37 patients, and after 19 patients withdrew, 18 concluded the study without experiencing any adverse events. The mean patient age was 39.9 years. Geometric IELT after the 8-week training with the MTCK increased significantly (mean ± SE; 232.10 ± 72.16 seconds) vs baseline (103.91 ± 50.61 seconds, P = .006). Mean scores on the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool, Difficulty in Performing Sexual Intercourse Questionnaire-5, and Erection Hardness Score after 8-week training improved significantly vs the baseline values. The mean score on the Sexual Health Inventory for Men did not improve significantly after the 8-week training, but domain 1 did significantly improve after 8 weeks of MTCK use. The MTCK may be one possible treatment option for patients who are unable to delay ejaculation. This is the first study to show that the MTCK is effective for patients who are unable to delay ejaculation. A major limitation is that the present study was not strictly limited to an IELT <3 minutes. The MTCK may offer benefits not only for delay of ejaculation but also for erectile function.","",""

Her past medical history was significant for a craniopharyngioma resection four months prior. The postoperative course was complicated by severe delirium, panhypopituitarism, and diabetes insipidus. Notably, she was taking haloperidol and aripiprazole daily for four months to manage her delirium and psychotic episodes. Her preoperative brain MRI showed a compressive effect of the craniopharyngioma on the midbrain and nigrostriatum. Drug-induced Parkinsonism was initially suspected given extended treatment with antipsychotics. Haloperidol and aripiprazole were stopped, and benztropine was started with no improvement. Consequently, the patient was treated with carbidopa/levodopa with symptomatic improvement. A dopamine transporter (DaT) scan was done after starting carbidopa/levodopa and showed asymmetric decreased uptake in dopamine transporter in the striatum. Only one other case of Parkinsonism following craniopharyngioma resection was found in the literature review.

Several complications are associated with uncontrolled diabetes that include abnormal lipid levels/dyslipidemia. This may predispose T2DM patients to life-threatening cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the activities of lipids among T2DM patients. Methodology A case-control study involving 300 participants was conducted in the outpatient department of medicine attached to Mahavir Institute of Medical Sciences, Vikarabad, Telangana, India. The study included 150 T2DM patients and the same number of age-matched controls. In this study, 5 mL of fasting blood sugar (FBS) was collected from each participant for the estimation of lipids (total cholesterol (TC), triacylglyceride (TAG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and very low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C)) and glucose. Results The FBS levels among T2DM patients (211.6 ± 60.97 mg/dL) and non-diabetic individuals (87.34 ± 13.06 mg/dL) were significantly (p < 0001) different. Analysis of lipid chemistry that included TC (174.8 ± 38.28 mg/dL vs. 157.22 ± 30.34 mg/dL), TAG (173.14 ± 83.48 mg/dL vs. 133.94 ± 39.69 mg/dL), HDL-C (37.28 ± 7.84 mg/dL vs. 43.4 ± 10.82 mg/dL), LDL-C (113.44 ± 28.79 mg/dL vs. 96.72 ± 21.53 mg/dL), and VLDL-C (34.58 ± 19.02 mg/dL vs. 26.7 ± 8.61 mg/dL) revealed significant variations among T2DM and non-diabetic individuals. There was a 14.10% decrease in the activities of HDL-C among T2DM patients along with an increase in the activities of TC (11.18%), TAG (29.27%), LDL-C (17.29%), and VLDL-C (30%). Conclusions T2DM patients have demonstrated abnormal lipid activities/dyslipidemia compared to non-diabetic patients. Patients with dyslipidemia may be predisposed to cardiovascular diseases.

However, risk stratification may not always be helpful for those who would benefit from early screening, especially in non-Western settings. To determine the need for early screening for GDM among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in two tertiary hospitals in Nigeria. We conducted a cross-sectional study from December 2016 to May 2017. We identified women who presented at the antenatal clinics of the Federal Teaching Hospital Ido-Ekiti and Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado Ekiti. A total of 270 women who fulfilled the study inclusion criteria were enrolled. The 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was used to screen participants for GDM before 24 weeks and between 24 and 28 weeks for those who screened negative before 24 weeks. Pearson's chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, independent t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test were utilized in the final analysis. The median age of the women in the study was 30 (interquartile range: 27-32) years. Of our study participants, 40 (14.8%) were obese, 27 (10%) had a history of diabetes mellitus in a first-degree relative, and three (1.1%) women had a previous history of GDM. Twenty-one women (7.8%) were diagnosed with GDM, and six (28.6%) were diagnosed before 24 weeks.

The molecular mechanisms that cause the initiation and progression of NAFLD remain fully unclear. Inflammation is regarded as a significant mechanism which could result in cell death and tissue injury. Accumulation of leukocytes and hepatic inflammation are important contributors in NAFLD. Excessive inflammatory response can deteriorate the tissue injury in NAFLD. Thus, inhibition of inflammation improves NAFLD by reducing intrahepatic fat content, increasing β-oxidation of fatty acids, inducing hepato-protective autophagy, overexpressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- γ (PPAR-γ), as well as attenuating hepatocyte apoptosis and increasing insulin sensitivity.

With the advancement of an aging society, the number of patients with diabetes having multiple underlying diseases, such as hypertension, obesity, and chronic inflammation, is increasing. Thus, the concept of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has been accepted worldwide, and comprehensive treatment of patients with diabetes is required. Receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), a multiligand receptor, belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily is extensively expressed throughout the body. Various types of ligands, including advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs), high mobility group box 1, S100/calgranulins, and nucleic acids, bind to RAGE, and then induces signal transduction to amplify the inflammatory response and promote migration, invasion, and proliferation of cells. Furthermore, the expression level of RAGE is upregulated in patients with diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and chronic inflammation, suggesting that activation of RAGE is a common denominator in the context of DKD. Considering that ligand-and RAGE-targeting compounds have been developed, RAGE and its ligands can be potent therapeutic targets for inhibiting the progression of DKD and its complications. Here, we aimed to review recent literature on various signaling pathways mediated by RAGE in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. Our findings highlight the possibility of using RAGE-or ligand-targeted therapy for treating DKD and its complications.","",""

Gastroretentive tablets were prepared using a direct compression technique with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K15M (HPMC K15M) and sodium alginate as matrix-forming polymers and sodium bicarbonate as the gas-forming agent. A 32 full factorial design was adopted to optimize the flotation and release profile of the drug. The concentration of HPMC K15M and sodium alginate were taken as the independent variables, and the floating lag time, time required for 50% drug release, and time required for 90% drug release were taken as dependent variables. The compatibility between drug and excipients was assessed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The prepared tablets were evaluated for different parameters such as hardness, friability, drug content, floating time, in vitro dissolution, and stability. Dissolution data were analyzed using various kinetic models to ascertain the mechanism of drug release. Finally, a radiographic study was conducted to estimate the retention time of the optimized floating matrix tablets of mitiglinide inside the body. The results revealed that all the physical properties of the developed formulations were within standard limits. The formulation M3, with the maximum amount of both independent variables, was considered to be the optimized formulation based on the desirability value. In addition, the optimized M3 formulation showed stability for over 6 months, as evidenced by insignificant changes in lag time, drug release pattern, and other physical properties. Furthermore, radiographic examination indicated that the tablets remained afloat in gastric fluid for up to 12 h in the rabbit's stomach. In conclusion, the developed floating matrix tablet of mitiglinide could be regarded as a promising formulation that could release the drug in the stomach at a controlled rate and, hence, offer better management of type II diabetes.","",""

Clopidogrel resistance was identified in 31 patients (26.7%), and prasugrel resistance was identified in 4 patients (3.4%). Ticagrelor resistance was not detected. Therefore, 30.1% of patients were classified as drug-resistant. Perioperative bleeding was not detected in any patient. Hypertension was the most common disease recorded for patients being treated for cerebral aneurysm, and diabetes was the most common disease recorded for patients who underwent peripheral artery stenting (p = 0.002). Potent antiplatelet agents, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, have a low rate of resistance but are associated with an increased bleeding risk.

Nucleic acid-based electrochemical sensors (NBEs) are a specific type of biosensor that employs the target binding and conformational dynamics of nucleic acids for signal transduction. Currently, the vast majority of NBEs are fabricated via self-assembly of alkylthiols on Au electrodes. However, this architecture is limited in scope, as Au electrodes are not universally deployable for all potential NBE applications. Here, to expand the repertoire of materials on which NBEs can be made, we describe the multistep procedure for creating sensing monolayers of alkylphosphonic acids on a conductive oxide surface. Using such monolayers on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides, we couple redox reporter-modified nucleic acids and demonstrate signaling of procaine-binding NBE sensors in buffer and human serum. We investigate the operational stability of these NBE sensors to reveal faster signal loss relative to benchmark thiol-on-gold sensing layers, a result that arises due to poor stability of the underlying ITO.

While lifestyle changes, including dietary intervention are effective in mitigating or preventing MetS, there are no specific therapies against MetS. Typical western diets comprise of high saturated fatty acid, cholesterol, and simple sugar; consequently their consumption may increase the potential pathological developmental risk of MetS. Partial replacement of dietary fatty acids with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) is widely recommended measure to manage MetS-related disorders. In the present study, we used rat model to investigate the role of n-3 PUFA enriched beef tallows (BT) on MetS and tunicamycin (TM)-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, by partially replacing dietary fat (lard) with equal amounts of two different BTs; regular BT or n-3 PUFA-enriched BT. The experimental rats were randomly assigned to three different dietary groups (n = 16 per group): (1) high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFCD); (2) HFCD partially replaced with regular BT (HFCD + BT1); (3) HFCD partially replaced with n-3 enhanced BT (w/w) (HFCD + BT2). After 10 weeks of dietary intervention, each experimental rodent was intraperitoneally injected with either phosphate-buffered saline or 1 mg/kg body weight of TM. HFCD + BT2 showed improved dyslipidemia before TM injection, and increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels after TM injection. BT replacement groups had significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels, and decreased total cholesterol (TC) and TG levels in epididymal adipose tissue (EAT). Furthermore, BT replacement remarkably attenuated TM-induced unfolded protein responses (UPRs) in liver, showing reduced ER stress, with BT2 being more effective in the EAT. Therefore, our findings suggest that partially replacing dietary fats with n-3 PUFA to lower the ratio of n-6/n-3 PUFAs is beneficial in preventing pathological features of MetS by alleviating HFCD- and/or TM-induced dyslipidemia and ER stress.","",""

Dyshomeostasis of these components remains as one of the common features in both AD and T2Dm etiology. Recent advances in this course reveal that the metal/cofactor-peptide interactions and covalent binding can alarmingly enhance and modify the toxic reactivities, oxidize vital biomolecules, significantly contribute to the oxidative stress leading to cell apoptosis, and may precede the amyloid fibrils formation by altering their native folds. This perspective highlights this aspect of amyloidogenic pathology which revolves around the impact of the metals and cofactors in the pathogenic courses of AD and T2Dm including the active site environments, altered reactivities, and the probable mechanisms involving some highly reactive intermediates as well. It also discusses some in vitro metal chelation or heme sequestration strategies which might serve as a possible remedy.

However, the impact of the ketogenic diet on IRS in healthy individuals of a normal weight has been less well researched. This study presents a cross-sectional observational study that aimed to investigate the effect of low carbohydrate intake in healthy individuals of a normal weight with regard to glucose homeostasis, inflammatory, and metabolic parameters. The study included 120 participants who were healthy, had a normal weight (BMI 25 kg/m2), and had no history of a major medical condition. Self-reported dietary intake and objective physical activity measured by accelerometry were tracked for 7 days. The participants were divided into three groups according to their dietary intake of carbohydrates: the low-carbohydrate (LC) group (those consuming <45% of their daily energy intake from carbohydrates), the recommended range of carbohydrate (RC) group (those consuming 45-65% of their daily energy intake from carbohydrates), and the high-carbohydrate (HC) group (those consuming more than 65% of their daily energy intake from carbohydrates). Blood samples were collected for the analysis of metabolic markers. HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and HOMA of β-cell function (HOMA-β), as well as C-peptide levels, were used for the evaluation of glucose homeostasis. Low carbohydrate intake (<45% of total energy) was found to significantly correlate with dysregulated glucose homeostasis as measured by elevations in HOMA-IR, HOMA-β% assessment, and C-peptide levels. Low carbohydrate intake was also found to be coupled with lower serum bicarbonate and serum albumin levels, with an increased anion gap indicating metabolic acidosis. The elevation in C-peptide under low carbohydrate intake was found to be positively correlated with the secretion of IRS-related inflammatory markers, including FGF2, IP-10, IL-6, IL-17A, and MDC, but negatively correlated with IL-3. Overall, the findings of the study showed that, for the first time, low-carbohydrate intake in healthy individuals of a normal weight might lead to dysfunctional glucose homeostasis, increased metabolic acidosis, and the possibility of triggering inflammation by C-peptide elevation in plasma.","",""

The results of multivariable analysis showed that female sex (vs. male sex; odds ratio = 2.578; 95% confidence interval = 2.319-2.866; p < 0.001) was significantly associated with depression. Older age, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, low systolic blood pressure (SBP), smoking history, living alone, low glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), high triglycerides, and low uric acid were significantly associated with depression in the men. In the women, older age, DM, hypertension, low SBP, smoking history, alcohol history, education level of middle and high school (vs. lower than elementary school), living alone, high body mass index (BMI), menopause, low HbA1c, high triglycerides, high total cholesterol, low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and low uric acid were significantly associated with depression. Further, there were significant interactions between sex and DM (p = 0.047), smoking history (p < 0.001), alcohol use (p < 0.001), BMI (p = 0.022), triglyceride (p = 0.033), eGFR (p = 0.001), and uric acid (p = 0.004) on depression. In conclusion, our results showed sex differences in depression, and the women were significantly associated with depression compared to men. Furthermore, we also found sex differences among the risk factors associated with depression.","",""

Thus, this study aimed to assess the incidence and predictors of hyperglycemic emergencies among adult patients with diabetes. A retrospective follow-up study design was conducted among a randomly selected sample of 453 adult patients with diabetes. Data were entered into EPI data version 4.6 and analyzed using STATA version 14.0. A Cox-proportional hazard regression model was fitted to identify the independent predictors of hyperglycemic emergencies, and variables having a p < 0.05 in the multivariable model were considered statistically significant. Among the total adult patients with diabetes included in the study, 147 (32.45%) developed hyperglycemic emergencies. Hence, the overall incidence of hyperglycemic emergencies was 14.6 per 100 person-years observation. The incidence of diabetic ketoacidosis was 12.5 per 100 person-years (35.6 and 6.3 among T1DM and T2DM, respectively). The incidence of the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome was 2.1 per 100 person-years (0.9 and 2.4 among T1DM and T2DM, respectively). The overall median free survival time was 53.85 months.

Clinically, the spectrum of features is confined mainly to neurological tissues; however, cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus have been reported in 60 and 30% of the subjects, respectively. The accurate detection of GAA repeat count is of utmost importance for clinical genetic correlation, and no study so far has attempted an approach that is of high-throughput nature and defines the exact sequence of GAA repeats. Largely, the method for detection of GAA repeats so far is either through the conventional polymerase chain reaction-based screening or Southern blot, which remains the gold standard method. We utilized an approach of long-range targeted amplification of FXN-GAA repeats using Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform for accurate estimation of repeat length. We were able to achieve successful amplification of GAA repeats ranging from ∼120 to 1100 at ∼2600× mean coverage. The total throughput achievable through our protocol can allow for screening of up to 96 samples per flow cell in less than 24 h. The proposed method is clinically scalable and deployable for day-to-day diagnostics.

Detailed dietary food records were processed by specialized dietitians on the basis of a standard protocol. The study population was subdivided according to relative carbohydrate intake before surgery. Results: Before surgery, 30 patients had a moderate relative carbohydrate intake (26%-45%, M-CHO), a mean body mass index (BMI) of 40.4 ± 3.9 kg/m² and a mean glycated haemoglobin A1c (A1C) of 6.5 ± 1.2% compared to 20 patients with a high relative carbohydrate intake (> 45%, H-CHO), mean BMI of 40.9 ± 3.7 kg/m² (non-significant, NS) and a mean A1C of 6.2% (NS). One year after surgery, body weight, body composition and glycaemic status were similar in the M-CHO (n = 25) and H-CHO groups (n = 16), despite less caloric intake in the H-CHO group (1317 ± 285 g vs. 1646 ± 345 g in M-CHO, p < 0.01).

Methods: A prospective and open cohort of natural gas field workers was established to study the level of workplace psychosocial factors and their health effects, with a follow-up every 5 years. In October 2018, a cluster sampling method was used to conduct a baseline survey of 1737 workers in a natural gas field, including a questionnaire survey on demographic characteristics, workplace psychosocial factors and mental health outcomes, physiological indicators such as height and weight, and biochemical indicators such as blood routine, urine routine, liver function and kidney function. The baseline data of the workers were statistically described and analyzed. The psychosocial factors and mental health outcomes were divided into high and low groups according to the mean score, and the physiological and biochemical indicators were divided into normal and abnormal groups according to the reference range of normal values. Results: The age of 1737 natural gas field workers was (41.8±8.0) years old, and the length of service was (21.0±9.7) years. There were 1470 male workers (84.6%). There were 773 (44.5%) high school (technical secondary school) and 827 (47.6%) college (junior college) graduates, 1490 (85.8%) married (including remarriage after divorce), 641 (36.9%) smokers and 835 (48.1%) drinkers. Among the psychosocial factors, the detection rates of high levels of resilience, self-efficacy, colleague support and positive emotion were all higher than 50%. Among the mental health outcomes evaluation indexes, the detection rates of high levels of sleep disorder, job satisfaction and daily stress were 41.82% (716/1712), 57.25% (960/1677) and 45.87% (794/1731), respectively. The detection rate of depressive symptoms was 22.77% (383/1682). The abnormal rates of body mass index (BMI), triglyceride and low density lipoprotein were 46.74% (810/1733), 36.50% (634/1737) and 27.98% (486/1737), respectively.

This has led to calls for aggressive glycemic control in the preoperative period, including delay of treatment until glucose is reduced. However, it is not known whether there is a direct causal effect of blood glucose or whether adverse outcomes result from overall poorer health in patients with higher glucose. Analysis was performed using a retrospective database of patients aged 65 and older who underwent cancer surgery. The last measured preoperative glucose was the exposure variable. The primary outcome was extended LOS (>4 days). Secondary outcomes included mortality, acute kidney injury (AKI), major postoperative complications during the admission period, and readmission within 30 days. The primary analysis was a logistic regression with prespecified covariates: age, sex, surgical service, and the Memorial Sloan Kettering-Frailty Index. In an exploratory analysis, lasso regression was used to select covariates from a list of 4160 candidate variables. This study included 3796 patients with a median preoperative glucose of 104 mg/dL (interquartile range: 93-125). Higher preoperative glucose was univariately associated with increased odds of LOS > 4 days (odds ratio [OR]: 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22-1.73), with similar results for AKI, readmission, and mortality. Adjustment for confounders eliminated these associations for LOS (OR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.80-1.18]) and attenuated all other glucose-outcome associations. Lasso regression gave comparable results to the primary analysis. Using the upper bound of the respective 95% confidence interval, we estimated that, at best, successful reduction of elevated preoperative glucose would reduce the risk of LOS > 4 days, 30-day major complication, and 30-day mortality by 4%, 0.5%, and 1.3%, respectively. Poor outcomes following cancer surgery in older adults with elevated glucose are most likely related to poorer overall health in these patients rather than a direct causal effect of glucose. Aggressive glycemic management in the preoperative period has very limited potential benefits and is therefore unwarranted.","",""

A total of 34 interviews were completed: patients and relatives (n = 7), healthcare support workers (n = 8), registered nurses (n = 10) and senior managers/clinicians (n = 9). Analysis resulted in three themes: (i) Acceptance and confidence, (ii) benefits and (iii) concerns and coping strategies. Delegation was accepted by stakeholders on condition that appropriate training, supervision and governance was in place. Continuing contact between patients and registered nurses, and regular contact between registered nurses and healthcare support workers was deemed essential for clinical safety. Services were reliant on the contribution of healthcare support workers providing insulin injections, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Benefits for service and registered nurses included: flexible team working, increased service capacity and care continuity. Job satisfaction and career development was reported for healthcare support workers. Patients benefit from timely administration, and enhanced relationships with the nursing team. Concerns raised by all stakeholders included potential missed care, remuneration and task shifting. Delegation of insulin injections is acceptable to stakeholders and has many benefits when managed effectively. Demand for community nursing is increasing. Findings of this study suggest that delegation of insulin administration contributes to improving service capacity. Findings highlight the essential role played by key factors such as appropriate training, competency assessment and teamwork, in developing confidence in delegation among stakeholders.

One of the major routes of human exposure is through consumption of cooked meat, as certain cooking methods favor formation of HCAs. Recent epidemiological studies reported significant associations between dietary HCA exposure and insulin resistance and type II diabetes. However, no previous studies have examined if HCAs, independent of meat consumption, contributes to pathogenesis of insulin resistance or metabolic disease. In the present study, we have assessed the effect of three HCAs commonly found in cooked meat (2-amino-3,4,8-trimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline [MeIQ], 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline [MeIQx], and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine [PhIP]) on insulin signaling and glucose production. HepG2 or cryopreserved human hepatocytes were treated with 0-50 μM of MeIQ, MeIQx, or PhIP for 3 days. Treatment of HepG2 cells and hepatocytes with MeIQ and MeIQx resulted in a significant reduction in insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation, suggesting that HCA exposure decreases hepatic insulin signaling. HCA treatment also led to significant increases in expression of gluconeogenic genes, G6PC and PCK1, in both HepG2 and cryopreserved human hepatocytes. Additionally, the level of phosphorylated FOXO1, a transcriptional regulator of gluconeogenesis, was significantly reduced by HCA treatment in hepatocytes. Importantly, HCA treatment of human hepatocytes led to increases in extracellular glucose level in the presence of gluconeogenic substrates, suggesting that HCAs induce hepatic glucose production. The current findings suggest that HCAs induce insulin resistance and promote hepatic glucose production in human hepatocytes. This implicates that exposure to HCAs may lead to the development of type II diabetes or metabolic syndrome.","",""

We also compared the results with our previous findings in the IRAS-FS Mexican Americans. We confirmed increased plasma metabolite levels of branched-chain amino acids and their metabolic derivatives, 2-aminoadipate, 2-hydroxybutyrate, glutamate, arginine and its metabolic derivatives, carbohydrate metabolites, and medium- and long-chain fatty acids were associated with insulin resistance, while increased plasma metabolite levels in the glycine, serine and threonine metabolic pathway were associated with insulin sensitivity. We also observed a differential ancestral effect of glutamate on glucose homeostasis with significantly stronger effects observed in African Americans than those previously observed in Mexican Americans. We extended the observations that metabolites are useful biomarkers in the identification of prediabetes in individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes in African Americans. We revealed, for the first time, differential ancestral effect of certain metabolites (i.e., glutamate) on glucose homeostasis traits. Our study highlights the need for additional comprehensive metabolomic studies in well-characterized multiethnic cohorts.","",""

Participants received personalized information about their risk of developing diabetes and heart disease, stroke, colon cancer, and/or breast cancer (women). Then they completed survey items. We combined 2 items (recalled risk, perceived risk) to create a trichotomous risk skepticism variable (acceptance, overestimation, underestimation). Additional items assessed possible explanations for risk skepticism: 1) information evaluation skills (education, graph literacy, numeracy), 2) motivated reasoning (negative affect toward the information, spontaneous self-affirmation, information avoidance); 3) Bayesian updating (surprise), and 4) personal relevance (racial/ethnic identity). We used multinomial logistic regression for data analysis. Of the participants, 18% believed that their diabetes risk was lower than the information provided, 40% believed their risk was higher, and 42% accepted the information. Information evaluation skills were not supported as a risk skepticism explanation. Motivated reasoning received some support; higher diabetes risk and more negative affect toward the information were associated with risk underestimation, but spontaneous self-affirmation and information avoidance were not moderators. For Bayesian updating, more surprise was associated with overestimation. For personal relevance, belonging to a marginalized racial/ethnic group was associated with underestimation. There are likely multiple cognitive, affective, and motivational explanations for risk skepticism. Understanding these explanations and developing interventions that address them will increase the effectiveness of precision medicine and facilitate its widespread implementation.","",""

MicroRNA (MiR)-17-5p is downregulated in DM and plays a key role in vascular protection. Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-released exosomes (EPC-EXs) contribute to vascular protection and ischemic tissue repair by transferring their contained miRs to target cells. Here, we investigated whether miR-17-5p-enriched EPC-EXs (EPC-EXsmiR-17-5p) had conspicuous effects on protecting vascular and skeletal muscle in DHI in vitro and in vivo. EPCs transfected with scrambled control or miR-17-5p mimics were used to generate EPC-EXs and EPC-EXsmiR-17-5p. Db/db mice were subjected to hind limb ischemia. After the surgery, EPC-EXs and EPC-EXsmiR-17-5p were injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of the hind limb once every 7 days for 3 weeks. Blood flow, microvessel density, capillary angiogenesis, gastrocnemius muscle weight, structure integrity, and apoptosis in the hind limb were assessed. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and myoblast cells (C2C12 cells) were subjected to hypoxia plus high glucose (HG) and cocultured with EPC-EXs and EPC-EXsmiR-17-5p. A bioinformatics assay was used to analyze the potential target gene of miR-17-5p, the levels of SPRED1, PI3K, phosphorylated Akt, cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3 were measured, and a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) was used for pathway analysis. In the DHI mouse model, miR-17-5p was markedly decreased in hind limb vessels and muscle tissues, and infusion of EPC-EXsmiR-17-5p was more effective than EPC-EXs in increasing miR-17-5p levels, blood flow, microvessel density, and capillary angiogenesis, as well as in promoting muscle weight, force production and structural integrity while reducing apoptosis in gastrocnemius muscle. In Hypoxia plus HG-injured ECs and C2C12 cells, we found that EPC-EXsmiR-17-5p could deliver their carried miR-17-5p into target ECs and C2C12 cells and subsequently downregulate the target protein SPRED1 while increasing the levels of PI3K and phosphorylated Akt. EPC-EXsmiR-17-5p were more effective than EPC-EXs in decreasing apoptosis and necrosis while increasing viability, migration, and tube formation in Hypoxia plus HG-injured ECs and in decreasing apoptosis while increasing viability and myotube formation in C2C12 cells. These effects of EPC-EXsmiR-17-5p could be abolished by a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002).

Overall, the presented cumulative evidence supports the benefits of GLP-1RA plus SGLT2i combination therapy on metabolic-cardiovascular-renal disease in patients with T2DM, with a low hypoglycemia risk. Accordingly, we encourage the adoption of GLP-1RA plus SGLT2i combination therapy in patients with T2DM and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or multiple risk factors for ASCVD (i.e., age ≥ 55 years, overweight/obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, current tobacco use, left ventricular hypertrophy, and/or proteinuria). Regarding renal effects, the evidence of SGLT2is in preventing kidney failure is more abundant than for GLP-1RAs, which showed a beneficial effect on albuminuria but not on hard kidney endpoints. Hence, in case of persistent albuminuria and/or uncontrolled metabolic risks (i.e., inadequate glycemic control, hypertension, overweight/obesity) on SGLT2i therapy, GLP-1RAs should be considered as the preferential add-on therapy in T2DM patients with chronic kidney disease. Despite the potential clinical benefits of GLP-1RA plus SGLT2i combination therapy in patients with T2DM, several factors may delay this combination to become a common practice soon, such as reimbursement and costs associated with polypharmacy. Altogether, when administering GLP-1RA plus SGLT2i combination therapy, it is important to adopt an individualized approach to therapy taking into account individual preferences, costs and coverage, toxicity profile, consideration of kidney function and glucose-lowering efficacy, desire for weight loss, and comorbidities.","",""

In most of these studies, antioxidant status and oxidative stress, inflammatory response, apoptosis rate, lipid profiles, and glucose levels were monitored in diabetic heart tissue. According to our findings, both Mel and exercise can improve antioxidant capacity by activating antioxidant enzymes compared to the control diabetic groups (p < 0.05). The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-α were reduced in diabetic rodents after being treated with Mel and exercise. Apoptotic changes were diminished in diabetic rodents subjected to the Mel regime and exercise in which p53 levels and the activity of Caspases reached near normal levels (p < 0.05). Based on the data, both Mel and exercise can change the lipid profile in diabetic rodents, especially rats, and close it to near-to-control levels.

T2DM patients with multivessel non-obstructive coronary stenosis (Mv-NOCS) have over-inflammation and over-lipids' plaque accumulation. This could reduce fibrous cap thickness (FCT), favoring plaque rupture and MACEs. Despite this, there is not conclusive data about the effects of SGLT2-I on atherosclerotic plaque phenotype and MACEs in Mv-NOCS patients with T2DM. Thus, in the current study, we evaluated SGLT2-I effects on Mv-NOCS patients with T2DM in terms of FCT increase, reduction of systemic and coronary plaque inflammation, and MACEs at 1 year of follow-up. In a multi-center study, we evaluated 369 T2DM patients with Mv-NOCS divided in 258 (69.9%) patients that did not receive the SGLT2-I therapy (Non-SGLT2-I users), and 111 (30.1%) patients that were treated with SGLT2-I therapy (SGLT2-I users) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) evaluation.

SGLT2-I users vs. Non-SGLT2-I users, as evaluated by OCT, evidenced the highest values of minimum FCT, and lowest values of lipid arc degree and macrophage grade (p < 0.05). At the follow-up end, SGLT2-I users vs. Non-SGLT2-I users had a lower rate of MACEs [n 12 (10.8%) vs. n 57 (22.1%); p < 0.05].

Type-1 diabetes could occur at any age, but predominantly in children and young adults. The risk of developing type II diabetes mellitus in the offspring of parents with DM II is 40% if one parent has DM II and approaches 70% if both parents have DM II. The process of developing diabetes from normal glucose tolerance is continuous, with insulin resistance being the first stage. As prediabetes progresses slowly to DM II, it may take approximately 15-20 years for an individual to become diabetic. This progression can be prevented or delayed by taking some precautions and making some lifestyle amendments, e.g., reducing weight by 5-7% of total body weight if obese, etc. Retinoblastoma protein is one of the pocket proteins that act as crucial gatekeepers during the G1/S transition in the cell cycle. A loss or defect in single-cell cycle activators (especially CDK4 and CDK6) leads to cell failure. In diabetic or stress conditions, p53 becomes a transcription factor, resulting in the transactivation of CKIs, which leads to cell cycle arrest, cell senescence, or cell apoptosis. Vitamin D affects insulin sensitivity by increasing insulin receptors or the sensitivity of insulin receptors to insulin. It also affects peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) and extracellular calcium. These influence both insulin resistance and secretion mechanisms, undertaking the pathogenesis of type II diabetes. Conclusion: The study confines a marked decrement in the levels of random and fasting blood glucose levels upon regular vitamin D intake, along with a significant elevation of retinoblastoma protein levels in the circulatory system. The most critical risk factor for the occurrence of the condition came out to be family history, showing that patients with first-degree relatives with diabetes are more susceptible. Factors such as physical inactivity or comorbid conditions further aggravate the risk of developing the disease. The increase in pRB levels caused by vitamin D therapy in prediabetic patients directly influences blood glucose levels. pRB is supposed to play a role in maintaining blood sugar levels. The results of this study could be used for further studies to evaluate the role of vitamin D and pRB in regeneration therapy for beta cells in prediabetics.","",""

This study aims to characterize the robustness of bariatric surgery RCTs by examining their FIs. A search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from January 2000 to February 2022 for RCTs comparing two bariatric surgeries with statistically significant dichotomous outcomes. Bivariate correlation was conducted to identify associations between FI and trial characteristics. A total of 35 RCTs were included with a median sample size of 80 patients (Interquartile range [IQR] 58-109). The median FI was 2 (IQR 0-5), indicating that altering the status of two patients in one treatment arm would overturn the statistical significance of results. Subgroup analyses of RCTs evaluating diabetes-related outcomes produced a FI of 4 (IQR 2-6.5), while RCTs comparing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy had an FI of 2 (IQR 0.5-5). Increasing FI was found to be correlated with decreasing P value, increasing sample size, increasing number of events, and increasing journal impact factor. Bariatric surgery RCTs are fragile, with only a few patients required to change from non-events to events to reverse the statistical significance of most trials. Future research should examine the use of FI in trial design.","",""

In the present study, the anti-diabetic effect of apigenin on pancreatic β-cell insulin secretion, apoptosis, and the mechanism underlying its anti-diabetic effects, were investigated in the INS-ID β-cell line. The results showed that apigenin concentration-dependently facilitated 11.1-mM glucose-induced insulin secretion, which peaked at 30 µM. Apigenin also concentration-dependently inhibited the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling proteins, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) and cleaved caspase-3, which was elevated by thapsigargin in INS-1D cells, with peak suppression at 30 µM. This was strongly correlated with the results of flow cytometric analysis of annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and DNA fragmentation analysis. Moreover, the increased expression of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) induced by thapsigargin was remarkably reduced by apigenin in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that apigenin is an attractive candidate with remarkable and potent anti-diabetic effects on β-cells, which are mediated by facilitating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and preventing ER stress-mediated β-cell apoptosis, the latter of which may be possibly mediated by reduced expression of CHOP and TXNIP, thereby promoting β-cell survival and function.","",""

In the present study, we investigated and tested the hypothesis that olanzapine induces oxidative stress in the hypothalamus and induces metabolic side effects. We also examined its association with sex differences. Olanzapine was administered intraperitoneally to male and female C57BL/6 mice, and the expression levels of oxidative stress-responsible genes in the hypothalamus and cerebral cortex were measured by qRT-PCR. In addition, olanzapine was administered intraperitoneally to C57BL/6 and Nrf2 KO mice, and the expression level of total glutathione was measured. Gene expressions induced by the Keap1-Nrf2-regulated system showed different responses to olanzapine for each gene. Under the conditions of this experiment, cystine-glutamate transporter was decreased although heme oxygenase-1 and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase were increased. It was also clear that these responses were not hypothalamus-specific. Long-term feeding with olanzapine suppressed weight gain in males but not females. No glucose intolerance was observed at 13 weeks of administration. Furthermore, deaths occurred only in females. In conclusion, this study failed to provide evidence that olanzapine induces oxidative stress in a hypothalamic-specific manner.

The current study sought to identify the impact of glycemic control on the neural dynamics serving working memory in adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants (n = 34, ages = 55-73) performed a working memory task while undergoing MEG. Significant neural responses were examined relative to poorer (A1c > 7.0%) or tighter glycemic control (A1c < 7.0%). Those with poorer glycemic control showed diminished responses within left temporal and prefrontal regions during encoding and showed diminished responses within right occipital cortex during maintenance but showed an enhanced activity in the left temporal, occipital, and cerebellar regions during maintenance. Notably, left temporal activity in encoding and left lateral occipital activity in maintenance significantly predicted performance on the task such that diminished temporal activity led to longer reaction times, which were driven by the poorer glycemic control group. Greater lateral occipital activity during maintenance was associated with both lower accuracy and longer reaction times across all participants. These findings suggest that glycemic control has a robust impact on the neural dynamics serving working memory, with distinct effects by subprocess (e.g. encoding vs. maintenance) and direct effects on behavior.","",""

However, simultaneous detection of DDC markers usually requires labor- and time-consuming steps. Here, a novel cloth-based single-working-electrode electrochemiluminescence (SWE-ECL) sensor was designed for the simultaneous detection of multiple DDC markers. For this sensor, three independent ECL cells are distributed on the SWE, which is a simplification of the configuration of traditional sensors for simultaneous detection. In this way, the modification processes and ECL reactions occur at the back of the SWE, eliminating the adverse effects caused by human intervention on the electrode. Under optimized conditions, glucose, uric acid and lactate were determined, with corresponding linear dynamic ranges of 80-4000 μM, 45-1200 μM and 60-2000 μM, and detection limits of 54.79 μM, 23.95 μM and 25.82 μM, respectively. In addition, the cloth-based SWE-ECL sensor exhibited good specificity and satisfactory reproducibility, and its actual application potential was verified by measuring complex human serum samples. Overall, this work developed a simple, sensitive, low-cost and rapid method for the simultaneous quantitative determination of multiple markers related to DDC and demonstrated a new route for multiple-marker detection.","",""

Patient demographics, delivery outcomes, COVID-19 symptoms, treatment, and outcomes were analyzed.Results: A total of 56 COVID-19-positive obstetric patients were included in the study, of which four were lost to follow-up before delivery. The median age of patients was 27 years (IQR 23, 32), with 73.2% publicly insured and 66.1% Black. Patients had a median body mass index (BMI) of 31.6 kg/m2 (IQR 25.9, 35.5). 3.6% of patients had chronic hypertension, 12.5% had diabetes, and 16.1% had asthma. Perinatal complications were common. Twenty-six patients (50.0%) had a diagnosis of a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP). 28.8% had gestational hypertension, and 21.2% had preeclampsia (with and without severe features). The rate of maternal ICU admission was 3.6%.

Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, irrespective of maternal disease severity, may exacerbate existing obstetric health disparities by disproportionately impacting Black, publicly insured patients. Larger comparative studies are needed to better characterize possible racial and socioeconomic disparities in obstetric outcomes in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. These studies should examine the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, as well as potential associations between adverse perinatal outcomes and disparities in access to care, COVID-19 vaccination, and other social determinants of health amongst more vulnerable populations infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy.","",""

The isolated fraction FAPP-2D with HG domain showed excellent anti-diabetic activity in insulin resistance model in L6 cell. We found that FAPP-2D increased the ADP/ATP ratio and inhibited PKA phosphorylation, activating the LKB1-AMPK pathway. Moreover, FAPP-2D activated AMPK-PGC1α pathway, which could stimulated mitochondrial production and regulate energy metabolism, promoting GLUT4 protein transport to achieve an anti-diabetic effect. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data showed that the LTP modification could increase the CH bond content while decreasing the C-O-C/C-O bond content, indicating that LTP destroyed the C-O-C/C-O bond, which enhanced the anti-diabetes activity of the modified apricot pectin polysaccharide.

Furthermore, recommended daily allowances for vitamin D have been established and large clinical trials of vitamin D, aimed at clarifying the effect of Vitamin D in the prevention of multiple diseases, have been completed. However, disappointingly, these clinical trials have not fulfilled the expectations many had 10 years ago. In almost every trial, various doses and routes of administration did not show efficacy of vitamin D in preventing fractures, falls, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, asthma, and respiratory infections. Although concerns about side-effects of long-term high-dose treatments, such as hypercalcaemia and nephrocalcinosis, have been around for four decades, some trials from the past 5 years have had new and unexpected adverse events. These adverse events include increased fractures, falls, and hospitalisations in older people (aged >65 years).

Furthermore, more attention should be paid to the safety of high doses of vitamin D supplementation, particularly in older people. In addition, despite universal recommendations by osteoporosis societies for combining calcium supplements with vitamin D there remains insufficient data about their efficacy and effect on fracture risk in the highest risk groups.

This study aims to describe and assess the effect of comorbidities on healthcare expenditures (direct medical cost and non-medical costs including transportation and compensatory allowances) for patients with ESKD in France while considering the modality and duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT). This study included adults who started RRT for the first time between 2012 and 2014 in France and were followed for 5 years. Generalized linear models were built to predict mean monthly cost (MMC) by integrating first the time duration in the cohort, then patient characteristics and finally the duration of use of each treatment modalities. Comorbidities with the highest effect on MMC were inability to walk (+ 1435€), active cancer (+ 593€), HIV positivity (+ 507€) and diabetes (+ 396€). These effects vary according to age or treatment modalities. This study confirms the importance of considering patient characteristics, comorbidities and type of RRT when assessing healthcare expenditures for patients with ESKD.","",""

PWV ≥10 m/s was present in 808 (11%), 191 (16%), 200 (27%) and CACS ≥100 in 801 (11%), 190 (16%), 191 (28%) participants with normoglycaemia, pre-diabetes and diabetes, respectively, all, p < 0.001. The overlap between PWV ≥10 m/s and CACS ≥100 within each glycaemic category was 188 (2.5%), 44 (3.6%) and 77 (10) respectively. There was an association between glycaemic status and increased PWV in the fully adjusted models, but not for glycaemic status and CACS ≥100, where there was no difference for pre-diabetes compared to normoglycaemia, OR 1.2 (95% CI 0.98-1.4). In the total study population, there was an association between HbA1c and PWV after adjustment, p < 0.001. Our results show that increased arterial stiffness and subclinical coronary artery atherosclerosis are present in the early stages of dysglycaemia, but the overlap between markers of major subclinical vascular damage was small in all glycaemic categories. This could be explained by different pathways in the pathogenesis of arterial stiffness or atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries.","",""

From 2009 to 2020, a single-institution retrospective study was conducted to compare shunted iNPH patients with a homogeneous control group. QOL was analyzed using the SF-36 questionnaire with yearly follow-up for as long as 11 years. Severity of symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical data were also recorded. Among 187 treated patients, 15 had died at the time of the authors' evaluation, and 45 did not match the inclusion criteria. The mean ± SD (range) follow-up was 118.5 ± 4.2 (18-132) months. QOL improved in 103/130 (79%) patients through 5 years after shunt surgery, although it remained lower than that of the control group (p < 0.0001). The SF-36 score reduced progressively, reaching baseline at 5-7 years of follow-up and decreased to below baseline at 7-11 years of follow-up (p < 0.0001). Predictors of improved QOL were younger age (p < 0.001), lower body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001), and better Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) performance (p < 0.001) before surgery. Decreased postoperative QOL was associated with cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, and severity of symptoms (gait and cognition) at presentation (p < 0.001). VPS implantation, along with a strict and comprehensive follow-up, has been shown to improve QOL in iNPH patients for as long as 5 years after surgery.

In addition, the potential role of PCSK9 in the observed changes was further investigated by using PCSK9 deficient mice. We used two in vivo models: mice kept on HFD for 20 weeks and PCSK9-/- mice. The amount of the major TGs, DGs and CERs was measured by using HPLC-MS/MS analysis. The expression profiles of four lipid related genes, namely Pcsk9, Ldlr, Cd36 and Anxa2 were assessed. Co-localization studies were performed by confocal microscopy. In HFD mice, hepatic PCSK9 expression was decreased and ANXA2 expression was increased both on mRNA and protein levels, and the amount of LDLR and CD36 receptor proteins was increased. While LDLR protein level was also elevated in the livers of PCSK9-/- mice, there was no significant change in the expression of ANXA2 and CD36 in these animals. HFD induced a significant elevation in the hepatic levels of all measured TG and DG but not of CER types, and increased the proportion of monounsaturated vs. saturated TGs and DGs. Similar changes were detected in the hepatic lipid profiles of HFD and PCSK9-/- mice. Co-localization of PCSK9 with LDLR, CD36 and ANXA2 was verified in HepG2 cells. Our results show that obesogenic HFD downregulates PCSK9 expression in the liver and causes alterations in the hepatic lipid accumulation, which resemble those observed in PCSK9 deficiency. These findings suggest that PCSK9-mediated modulation of LDLR and CD36 expression might contribute to the HFD-induced changes in lipid homeostasis.","",""

However, management of AIFRS is challengeable especially in developing countries due to limited resources and high prices of antifungal agents. No previous studies have been conducted to evaluate the outcomes of management of AIFRS in Syria. The purpose of this study is to report the results of management of AIFRS with low doses of liposomal amphotericin B in our tertiary hospital in Syria. The outcomes of management of AIFRS cases were followed through a prospective observational study between January 2021 and July 2022. The required medical data were collected for each individual. Three-month mortality rate was studied. SPSS v.26 was used to perform the statistical analysis. Pearson Chi-square test was used to study the associations between different variables and mortality. Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier to compare the survival probability. Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) test and Cox regression were conducted to evaluate the factors affecting survival within the follow up period. Of 70 cases, 36 (51.4%) were males and 34 (48.6%) were females. The mean age of patients was 52.5 years old. The most common underlying risk factor was diabetes mellitus (84.3%). The used dose of liposomal amphotericin B ranged between 2-3 mg/kg per day. The overall 3-month mortality rate was 35.7%. Significant association was found between survival and the following variables: Age, orbital involvement, stage, and comorbidity. The overall mortality rate was close to other studies. However, survival rate was worse than comparable studies in selected cases of AIFRS (older ages, involved orbits, advanced stages, and chronic immunodeficiency). Therefore, low doses of liposomal amphotericin B could be less effective in such cases and high doses are recommended.","",""

This systematic review provides an overview on the impact of digital health interventions for adolescents with type 1 diabetes on health literacy and derive recommendations for further research. Electronic searches were performed in five databases in Medline (Medline, PubMed + via PubMed), The Cochrane Library, EMBASE (via Ovid), Web of Science and PsycINFO from 2011 to 2021. In addition, grey literature searches were conducted in Google Scholar, OAlster and Trip. Relevant studies that have been missed by electronic and hand-searching strategies were searched in the reference lists of all included studies. The review followed PRISMA guidelines. Two researchers independently screened abstracts for initial eligibility and applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to the relevant full-text articles. Quality was assessed using the tools RoB2 Cochrane, ROBINS I, NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale), CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) for primary studies and Amstar-2 for secondary studies. Out of 981 studies, 22 were included in the final review. Most primary studies included in this review were judged as moderate overall risk of bias or with some concerns and most of the secondary studies as critically low quality reviews. Our findings suggest that the interplay of health care providers (HCP) and patients through social media helps the management of the disease. This corroborates Bröder et al.' (2017) dimension of 'communication and interactions' in their concept of health literacy. For adolescents with T1DM, social media may be a specific and beneficial intervention for an improved communication and interaction with their HCP.

However, the effect and mechanisms by which this decoction alleviates diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis are unknown and require exploration. This study aims to investigate the pharmacological effects of BYHWD on preventing diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis, and elucidate its underlying mechanism. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic ApoE-/- mice were treated with BYHWD. Atherosclerotic aortic lesions, endothelial function, mitochondrial morphology, and mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins were evaluated in isolated aortas. High glucose-exposed human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with BYHWD and its components. AMPK siRNA transfection, Drp1 molecular docking, Drp1 enzyme activity measurement, and so on were used to explore and verify the mechanism. BYHWD treatment inhibited the worsening of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis by lessening atherosclerotic lesions in diabetic ApoE-/- mice, by impeding endothelial dysfunction under diabetic conditions, and by inhibiting mitochondrial fragmentation by lowering protein expression levels of Drp1 and mitochondrial fission-1 protein (Fis1) in diabetic aortic endothelium. In high glucose-exposed HUVECs, BYHWD treatment also downgraded reactive oxygen species, promoted nitric oxide levels, and abated mitochondrial fission by reducing protein expression levels of Drp1 and fis1, but not mitofusin-1 and optic atrophy-1. Interestingly, we found that BYHWD's protective effect against mitochondrial fission is mediated by AMPK activation-dependent reduction of Drp1 levels. The main serum chemical components of BYHWD, ferulic acid, and calycosin-7-glucoside, can reduce the expression of Drp1 by regulating AMPK, and can inhibit the activity of GTPase of Drp1. The above findings support the conclusion that BYHWD suppresses diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis by reducing mitochondrial fission through modulation of the AMPK/Drp1 pathway.","",""

Cardiorenal outcomes, kidney function, and safety outcomes were evaluated by baseline age (≥65 years and <65 years [prespecified] and ≥75 years and <75 years [post hoc]). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01986881. Between Dec 13, 2013, and July 31, 2015, and between June 1, 2016, and April 14, 2017, 8246 adults with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were recruited to the study and randomly assigned. 2752 patients were assigned to ertugliflozin 5 mg, 2747 patients to ertugliflozin 15 mg, and 2747 patients to placebo. 8238 participants received at least one dose of ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, or placebo. 4145 (50·3%) of 8238 participants were aged 65 years and older, including 903 (11·0%) participants aged 75 years and older. 5764 (70·0%) of 8238 participants were male and 2474 (30·0%) were female, and 7233 (87·8%) of 8238 participants were White, 497 (6·0%) were Asian, 235 (2·9%) were Black, and 273 (3·3%) were classified as other. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower and the type 2 diabetes duration longer for those aged 65 years and older versus those younger than 65 years, and for those aged 75 years and older versus those younger than 75 years. Cardiovascular outcomes were more common in the older age subgroups than in the younger age subgroups. Similar to the overall VERTIS CV cohort, ertugliflozin did not increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure, cardiovascular death alone, or the kidney composite outcome (using doubling of serum creatinine, dialysis or transplantation, or kidney death), and reduced the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure and the exploratory kidney composite outcome (using a 40% sustained eGFR decrease, dialysis or transplantation, or kidney death) in the older age subgroups (pinteraction>0·05 for outcomes assessed). A slower decline in eGFR and a smaller increase in the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio were observed over time in all age subgroups taking ertugliflozin compared with placebo. Across age subgroups, safety outcomes were consistent with the known profile of ertugliflozin. The effects of ertugliflozin on cardiorenal outcomes, kidney function, and safety outcomes were generally similar across age subgroups. These results have the potential to help clinical decision making by providing a longer-term evaluation of the cardiorenal safety and overall tolerability of ertugliflozin in a large population of older adults.

In this work, a paper-based analytical device (PAD) is constructed by combining acetylene black (AB)-hemin complex modified filter paper as sensing platform with a smartphone as signal detector. Large specific surface area of AB decreases the self-associate and aggregate of hemin in aqueous solution, resulting in improved peroxidase-like activity of hemin. Compared with graphene oxide supported hemin, AB-hemin exhibits superior signal response on paper. Glucose oxidase (GOx) catalyzes the conversion of blood glucose to hydrogen peroxide, and then AB-hemin complex catalyzes the oxidation of colorless 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to blue TMB oxidized products (TMB+) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, thus achieving the visual detection of blood glucose. In optimal conditions, PAD provides an applicable linear range from 0.2 mM to 30 mM and a low limit of detection (LOD) (0.06 mM). Notably, the detection accuracy of the developed paper-based sensor is in good agreement with that of the commercially available blood glucose meter (p > 0.05). Moreover, the proposed PAD presents high recoveries from 95.4% to 112% (RSD ≤ 3.2%), and therefore holds great potential for glucose monitoring and diabetes diagnosis.","",""

A hospital database was used to obtain birth/placental weight, cord PO2 and other information on patients delivering between Jan 1, 1990 and Jun 15, 2011 with GA >34 weeks (N = 69,854). Oxygen saturation was calculated from the cord PO2 and pH data, while fetal O2 extraction was calculated from the oxygen saturation data. The effect of diabetic status on birth/placental weight and cord oxygen values was examined adjusting for covariates. Birth/placental weights were stepwise decreased in GDM and DM compared to non-diabetics with placentas disproportionally larger indicating decreasing placental efficiency. Umbilical vein oxygen was marginally increased in GDM but decreased in DM attributed to the previously reported hyper-vascularization in diabetic placentas with absorbing surface area of capillaries initially increased, but then constrained by increasing distance from maternal blood within the intervillous space. Umbilical artery oxygen was unchanged in GDM and DM, with fetal O2 extraction decreased in DM indicating that fetal O2 delivery must be increased relative to O2 consumption and likely due to increased umbilical blood flow. Increased villous density/hyper-vascularization in GDM and DM with placentas disproportionately larger and umbilical blood flow increased, are postulated to normalize umbilical artery oxygen despite increased birth weights and growth-related O2 consumption. These findings have implications for mechanisms signaling fetal-placental growth and development in diabetic pregnancies and differ from that reported with maternal obesity.","",""

However, it remains unclear whether dyslipidaemia is causative for NAFLD. This Mendelian randomisation (MR) study aimed to explore the causal role of lipid traits in NAFLD and evaluate the potential effect of lipid-lowering drug targets on NAFLD. Genetic variants associated with lipid traits and variants of genes encoding lipid-lowering drug targets were extracted from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS). Summary statistics for NAFLD were obtained from two independent GWAS datasets. Lipid-lowering drug targets that reached significance were further tested using expression quantitative trait loci data in relevant tissues. Colocalisation and mediation analyses were performed to validate the robustness of the results and explore potential mediators. No significant effect of lipid traits and eight lipid-lowering drug targets on NAFLD risk was found. Genetic mimicry of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) enhancement was associated with lower NAFLD risks in two independent datasets (OR1 = 0.60 [95% CI 0.50-0.72], p1 = 2.07 × 10-8; OR2 = 0.57 [95% CI 0.39-0.82], p2 = 3.00 × 10-3). A significant MR association (OR = 0.71 [95% CI, 0.58-0.87], p = 1.20 × 10-3) and strong colocalisation association (PP.H4 = 0.85) with NAFLD were observed for LPL expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Fasting insulin and type 2 diabetes mediated 7.40% and 9.15%, respectively, of the total effect of LPL on NAFLD risk. Our findings do not support dyslipidaemia as a causal factor for NAFLD. Among nine lipid-lowering drug targets, LPL is a promising candidate drug target in NAFLD. The mechanism of action of LPL in NAFLD may be independent of its lipid-lowering effects.

This review aimed to identify/quantify factors associated with prescribing of specific antidiabetic drug classes for T2DM. Five databases (Medline/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched using the synonyms of each concept (patients with T2DM, antidiabetic drugs and factors influencing prescribing) in both free text and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) forms. Quantitative observational studies evaluating factors associated with antidiabetic prescribing of metformin, sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4-I), sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2-I), Glucagon-Like peptide receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) and insulin in outpatient settings and published from January 2009 to January 2021 were included. Quality assessment was performed using a Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The validation was done for 20% of identified studies. The pooled estimate was measured using a three-level random-effect meta-analysis model based on odds ratio [95% confidence interval]. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI), glycaemic control (HbA1c) and kidney-related problems were quantified. Of 2331 identified studies, 40 met the selection criteria. Of which, 36 and 31 studies included sex and age, respectively, while 20 studies examined baseline BMI, HbA1c and kidney-related problems. The majority of studies (77.5%, 31/40) were rated as good and despite that the overall heterogeneity for each studied factor was more than 75%, it is mostly related to within-study variance. Older age was significantly associated with higher sulfonylurea prescription (1.51 [1.29-1.76]), yet lower prescribing of metformin (0.70 [0.60-0.82]), SGLT2-I (0.57 [0.42-0.79]) and GLP1-RA (0.52 [0.40-0.69]); while higher baseline BMI showed opposite significant results (sulfonylurea: 0.76 [0.62-0.93], metformin: 1.22 [1.08-1.37], SGLT2-I: 1.88 [1.33-2.68], and GLP1-RA: 2.35 [1.54-3.59]). Both higher baseline HbA1c and having kidney-related problems were significantly associated with lower metformin prescription (0.74 [0.57-0.97], 0.39 [0.25-0.61]), but more insulin prescriptions (2.41 [1.87-3.10], 1.52 [1.10-2.10]). Also, DPP4-I prescriptions were higher for patients with kidney-related problems (1.37 [1.06-1.79]) yet lower among patients with higher HbA1c (0.82 [0.68-0.99]). Sex was significantly associated with GLP1-RA and thiazolidinedione prescribing (F:M; 1.38 [1.19-1.60] and 0.91 [0.84-0.98]). Several factors were identified as potential determinants of antidiabetic drug prescribing. The magnitude and significance of each factor differed by antidiabetic class. Patient's age and baseline BMI had the most significant association with the choice of four out of the seven studied antidiabetic drugs followed by the baseline HbA1c and kidney-related problems which had an impact on three studied antidiabetic drugs, whereas sex had the least impact on prescribing decision as it was associated with GLP1-RA and thiazolidinedione only.","",""
